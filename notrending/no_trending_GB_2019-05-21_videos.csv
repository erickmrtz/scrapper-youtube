Both redefining and transcending the genre, “IT” became part of the cultural zeitgeist as well as the highest-grossing horror film of all time.Because every 27 years evil revisits the town of Derry, Maine, “It Chapter Two” brings the characters—who’ve long since gone their separate ways—back together as adults, nearly three decades after the events of the first film.

The creative minds behind Superbad, Pineapple Express and Sausage Party take on sixth grade hard in the outrageous comedy, Good Boys. After being invited to his first kissing party, 12-year-old Max (Room’s Jacob Tremblay) is panicking because he doesn’t know how to kiss. Eager for some pointers, Max and his best friends Thor (Brady Noon, HBO’s Boardwalk Empire) and Lucas (Keith L.

But when things go ridiculously wrong, the drone is destroyed. Desperate to replace it before Max’s dad (Will Forte, The Last Man on Earth) gets home, the boys skip school and set off on an odyssey of epically bad decisions involving some accidentally stolen drugs, frat-house paintball, and running from both the cops and terrifying teenage girls (Life of the Party’s Molly Gordon and Ocean’s Eight’s Midori Francis). From Point Grey producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the writers of Superbad, Pineapple Express and Sausage Party, and James Weaver (Neighbors), Good Boys, from Universal Pictures and Good Universe, is written by the team of Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky (NBC’s The Office, Bad Teacher).

It seems that even from his earlier days there existed darkness within him, a darkness that only grew with time. I believe Euron is a psychopath. According to the dictionary, psychopathy is defined by impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits. The word psychopath does not imply delusional thought or irrational action. Euron thinks extremely highly of himself and is incapable of empathizing with other people. And now he seeks final Ascension. The Horn, Victarion, and Holy Men all seem key to Euron’s Grand Plan.Thanks for watching!Cover Art by: Bella Bergolts: https://bergolts.artstation.com/projects/OV6dwPlease consider supporting this channel on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ideasoficeandfireThe Book I helped write: https://www.amazon.com/Thrones-Effect-HBOs-Conquered-Culture/dp/0998029947/ref=sr_1_1?crid=A2RMTG1N5WWR&keywords=the+thrones+effect&qid=1558142871&s=gateway&sprefix=thrones+eff%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRELike me on Facebook!: https://www.facebook.com/IOIAFFeel free to leave a comment like and subscribe!Thanks For Watching!"

A recap of “The Iron Throne” the series finale.  Got S8 E6 is the end of the road for our beloved characters. Please Subscribe now! - http://bit.ly/PetePeppersHBO’s Game of Thrones Season 8 has come to its end and Episode 6 was a series finale for the ages. The cultural phenomenon based on George RR Martin’s series A Song of Ice and Fire gave us the endings he layed out for Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen, and the Stark family. Bran, Sansa, and Arya Stark take center stage at the end of season 8 and we have to think that Ned Stark’s influence guided these characters.The series finale of Game of Thrones wasn’t perfect, but it did provide a satisfying end. King Bran the Broken was crowned, and his sister Sansa reigns as Queen in the independent Kingdom of the North. Arya Stark leaves behind a life of death to reclaim her humanity sailing to find out what’s west of Westeros. The seven kingdoms is now the six kingdoms and King Bran has a small council filled with fan favorite characters.While Daenerys’ story took a tragic turn, we are left feeling that the kingdoms of Westeros could turn out better as a result. Jon Snow was reunited with his direwolf Ghost, and his watch begins again at Castle Black. Tyrion is Hand of the King, Brienne is captain of the King’s guard, Bronn is master of coin, Davos Seaworth is master of ships, and Samwell Tarly is the Grandmaester of King’s Landing. The characters are all changed from their journeys, but the realm is changed for the better because they made them. The series finale of Game of Thrones is not only the end of Season 8, but the end of an era.What did you think about Game of Thrones season 8 episode 6, and how did you think it stacks up as a series finale?  What do you think about the characters’ endings and what they mean for the ending of George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire?  Let us know in the comments what you think about final season of Game of Thrones on HBO, and how the series finale made you feel.Game of Thrones Stuff:Game of Thrones Seasons 1-7: https://amzn.to/2VWCoxtFire and Blood: https://amzn.to/2TF3c9aA Song of Ice and Fire book series: https://amzn.to/2u2ffOmGoT Season 7: https://amzn.to/2Hwwv6b****New books for season 8 pre-orders:The Storyboards https://amzn.to/2UuRVEpThe Art of Game of Thrones https://amzn.to/2TwTNjCThe Photography of Game of Thrones https://amzn.to/2Txz8w4The Costumes of Game of Thrones https://amzn.to/2Uy8WOlGame of Thrones Theory Videos:Are the gods real - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM6lBzRQpdEGods part 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMSTgqOYjWoArthur Dayne - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDpmkdeH8toThe Isle of Faces - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfiwB5XmslAHowland Reed - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5P224p8zCgBran's Purpose - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y22-h3LdGKATourney History & Lore - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lke9hsjFrzYBran & Three Eyed Raven - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBqKCdVVuygWestworld Playlist - http://bit.ly/WestwoldS01Twin Peaks Season 3 Playlist - http://bit.ly/TwinPeaksS3Follow me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/PetePeppersJoin me on Patreon! - https://www.patreon.com/PetePeppersLike my Facebook Page - https://www.facebook.com/FleaBottomPete/Follow me on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/fleabottom_peteAsk me questions on Quora - https://www.quora.com/profile/Pete-Peppers#GameofThrones #GameofThronesSeason8 #GoTS8 #ForTheThrone"

What will be sweet about Got S8 E6?. Please Subscribe now! - http://bit.ly/PetePeppersHBO’s Game of Thrones Season 8 has come to its end and Episode 6 will be the series finale of this cultural phenomenon. In season 8 we have seen a lot of bitter turns, and fans are wondering how will the ending turn out to be bittersweet.Since Daenerys’ story had a turn that many fans didn’t see coming it’s looking like her end will be of the bitter variety. While she isn’t likely to survive the series she may inadvertently insured that the people of Westeros will never have to live under the rule of tyrants. Jon Snow may have to do the unthinkable in killing Daenerys, but he will bring balance to the realm by ending the existential threats of Ice and the White Walkers, and Fire from Daenerys and her dragons.We expect that Game of Thrones s8 episode 6 will have an epilogue to show us our favorite secondary characters after the wars are over. We guess that characters like Sam and Gilly, Arya, Sansa, and the Starks will have happy endings that come at great cost. Low born characters like Gendry, Davos, Bronn, and Tormund should live on to lead better lives. The smallfolk and people of Westeros will turn out to be the big winners of the story after suffering so much from the persistent wars.

What will happen in Got S8 E6?. Please Subscribe now! - http://bit.ly/PetePeppersHBO released a short Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 6 trailer, and only one photo of Tyrion to promote the series finale. This video looks at questions we have going into episode 6, and what is going to happen now that Daenerys has become the villain. Now that we’ve reached the ending of Game of Thrones we are left guessing how are favorite GoT characters’ stories will end. We don’t who will survive episode 6, and we don’t know who will be sitting on the Iron Throne at the end or if anyone will. Daenerys has taken King’s Landing but she did it in a way that will be hard for Jon Snow and Tyrion to approve of. This may mean that Dany will die before season 8 concludes.Since we don’t have much promotional material for Game of Thrones s8 episode 6 we have to look back at episode 5 for clues. We know directly after the sacking of King’s Landing that Jon, Davos, Tyrion, and Arya Stark are all in the city. Daenerys has taken control and her Dothraki and Unsullied made it through the battle with few casualties. What did you think will happen in Game of Thrones season 8 episode 6, and how do think Jon, Tyrion, and Arya will react to what happened in episode 5?  Do you fear that Daenerys bringing fire and blood is the end of her story?

This video breaks it down scene by scene and discusses what we might expect to see in the next episode of Game of Thrones’ final season. Episode 6 is the final episode in the series, and we expect a big finale for the show.We see Daenerys looking over her troops after the battle for King’s Landing. We see Jon Snow and Davos, Tyrion Lannister, and Arya Stark walking through the destruction that is left behind. The teaser doesn’t show us much more about episode 6, but we can speculate about what might happen in the finale.Game of Thrones s8 episode 6 will be one of the most anticipated 80 minutes of television in this era. Now that Daenerys has defeated Cersei what will she do in King’s Landing? We expect that Tyrion will be in a tough situation with the Queen, but how will Jon Snow deal with what he’s witnessed? Arya’s future is also interesting since she has witnessed the suffering first hand. We saw her take a turn in episode 5, but will she turn back and seek vengeance? Will Daenerys turn things around or has she become the Mad Queen who has to be stopped?What did you think will happen in Game of Thrones season 8 episode 6, and how do think Jon and Arya will react to what happened in episode 5?

Fans have worried she might go Mad Queen in GoT s8 e5 for a while. Please Subscribe now! - http://bit.ly/PetePeppersDaenerys Targaryen is a character that some fans really love and some fans actually hate. Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 4 we saw Dany lose nearly everything as she headed south to press her claim for the Iron Throne. After losing Jorah in the Long Night, she lost her dragon Rhaegal, and her closest adviser and friend Missandei. Cersei executed her right in front of Daenerys and this seems to have put her on a destructive path.In Game of Thrones season 8 episode 5 fans fear that Daenerys may lose her grip and burn King’s Landing to the ground. This is worrisome because the Queen has brought innocent civilians inside the Red Keep to act as human shields. Because Daenerys’ father Aerys II went crazy fans have had theories of Dany following the same path and becoming the mad queen. While this ending seemed unlikely so has and ending that sees Daenerys sit on the Iron Throne to rule the Seven Kingdoms. It’s always been difficult to figure how her story might end. With only two episodes of Game of Thrones left in its final season, we will probably get answers in episode 5. Fans who love Daenerys may not be happy with her ending, and may find it difficult to make sense of her story.What did you think will happen in Game of Thrones season 8 episode 5, and who do you think will control King’s Landing and the Iron Throne by the end?  Do you fear Daenerys will go mad?

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content.

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com Colorful Animation 4 SeaweedAnd from Kevin MacLeod Marty Gots a PlanThis is an educational video about the science of water quality."

It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.Filming by Raquel Nuno"

I just wanted an excuse to come over, you never call me anymore, you never invite me to play naked twister like you used to. Everything about our friendship has fallen apart.”Anth panicked and checked that no neighbours had heard the naked twister comment.“Well what do you expect?!” Exclaimed Anth. “All you ever do is come over and use my laptop to google ‘When is Conor Maynards’ 2nd album coming out”.. it’s weird bro.. plus, last time I woke up to you standing over me and you still never told me what you were doing before I woke up.”Conor looked back at Anth, sadness filling his eyes.. “So.. I guess this is goodbye?”“Yes Conor. It is.”Conor walked away from Anth’s house, with his head hanging low.Anth couldn’t bear to see his best friend hurting like this.. so he called out:“Hey… Conor… you got a Luigi costume for me too?”Conor turned around in excitement.“OF COURSE I DO!! It will fit you perfectly, I took your measurements while you were sleeping last time I stayed here.”Anth sighed… but was happy they were now friends again.They walked off into the sunset together.. Conor turned to Anth.“Oh.. by the way bro.. Merry Christmas.”“Conor, Christmas isn’t until December 25th.”“I know.. I was just making conversation.”Then Kanye West and Lil Pump called Conor & Anth personally and told them to film this remix then and there. This part of the story is definitely true and definitely isn’t made up because I couldn’t think of a way to connect my random story to the song.HUGE THANK YOU TO Erin Yasmeen for shooting the video and doing the animation and SillyIdeasCentre for supplying the costumes!

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends. Now, they will fight for the human race.

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends. Now, they will fight for the human race.

But to be honest I had never been to any outside of Brazil - and there was no better place to have my first Brazilian meat churrascaria experience than in Brazil.Churrascaria Palace (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/xtKKEisbcvWv9P8m6) - We chose to go to Churrascaria Palace, a meat restaurant located in Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro. As soon as I stepped into the restaurant, I could smell the aroma of the roasting meats, and it was a great upscale, yet laid back atmosphere, with live music.Chef Silva took care of us from the moment we stepped in and first showed us the kitchen where the meats were being roasted. It’s very interesting to learn about the different cuts of meat that they use in Brazil, which are unique to Brazil. One of the unique and beloved types of meat is cupim, which comes from the beef hump from Zebu cattle.Once Chef Silva started bringing us meats, he did not joke around - the Brazilian steakhouse bbq meats started flowing non stop. A Brazilian steakhouse bbq is typically served Rodízio, meaning it’s all you can eat, but the meat is not served buffet style, but rather it’s served to you at your plate. They slice it in front of you, and then you use your tongs to grab the meat as its sliced in front of you.Chef Silva served us 14 types of meat, including some Amazon river fish. He told us he only served us the premium cuts, and there were many other less premium cuts that we were too full to even try.Brazilian food is often heavy on the meat, and there’s no better way to experience Brazilian meat than with a churrascaria!Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

There are estimates of as many as 1,000 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many of the favelas in Rio de Janeiro are full cities within themselves, where nearly everything is available.It’s without a doubt that a lot of crime and organized underground criminal activity happens and is controlled in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. However, favelas across Brazil are home to some of the most hard working, friendly, happy, and creative people in Brazil as well. So in this video my goal was to meet and to highlight some of the amazing people that call favelas home. Rocinha - The first favela we visited was Rocinha, the biggest favela in Rio, one of the biggest in Brazil. We met up with Guilherme who took us on a walking tour to some viewpoints and to some Brazilian food places.Sabor da Roça - The most well known little snack shop on this street in Rocinha, we stopped for a coxinha, one of the top Brazilian food snacks. It was packed with chicken and with some hot sauce it was amazing. Price -  2.5 BRL ($0.63)For lunch we stopped at an alleyway restaurant in Rocinha, where he cooked up a lunch set included beef ribs, cassava, pasta, rice, and beans. It was simple, but delicious and hearty.Price - 10 BRL ($2.52)Morro da Providência - Favela number two is one of the first favelas of Rio and located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, near the port and up on a hill on the side of the cliff. We met up with Jura, who is an absolute Brazilian food cooking legend and an amazing person.One of Jura’s most famous dishes is nhoque de camarão, an Italian but Brazilian potato noodles in Jura’s own creation sauce of shrimp and coconut milk. It was simply outstanding, all made from scratch.But the dish I was most interested in eating and which Jura expertly cooked, again from scratch was her feijoada - often considered the national dish of Brazil, and one of my personal favorite foods of Brazil as well - there are few dishes of the world more comforting than beans and pig parts with rice. When you’re in Brazil, you can eat feijoada at many restaurants, but home-cooked is by far the best.Thank you Jura and Elena!!This was one of the best days I had in Brazil in terms of learning, meeting people, and food, and it’s an experience and memories I’ll never forget. You hear a lot of the negative that comes out of favelas in Brazil, and it is true. However, the positive side and the amazing people, are not often recognized, and it was truly memorable to see and learn about this side of hope in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

Finally, the time has come. In this Brazilian street food tour in Rio de Janeiro, we’ll go to eat some of the best street food snacks and dishes, some hole in the wall style Brazilian food restaurants, and also visit some of the most unbelievable and gorgeous sights and attractions in Rio de Janeiro. It’s one of the most beautiful cities I’ve ever visited.Here’s the Brazilian food and things we did:Mineiro, Sausage Sandwich - 5 BRL ($1.26) - For Brazilian breakfast we headed to Mineiro for his neighborhood grilled sausage sandwich, topped with his house made aioli dressing, cheese, and lettuce, and his own home-made chili sauce. He’s not only an amazing guy, but his sausage sandwich is outstanding. When you’re in Rio de Janeiro, you don’t want to miss it. Located just outside Siqueira Campos MRT Metro station (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA), sets up in the morning about 7 am.Trem do Corcovado - 65 BRL ($16.44) - Christ the Redeemer - I pre-bought tickets online for the tram, so when we arrived we just picked up and printed the tickets. The tram took about 20 minutes and Christ The Redeemer at the top was breathtaking.Selaron Steps - Another attraction in Rio de Janeiro that I wasn’t going to miss was the Selaron Steps, created by Chilean artist Selaron. They are so cool and so iconic.Lunch at Bar Rex - For some seriously meaty Brazilian food, Bar Rex is the spot. They serve an major selection of drinks, but they also specialize in food like roasted chicken, sausages, and the oxtail. The food was outstanding, and the owners are just so cool. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/ZeshTp5D3ggLoGx87Ipanema Beach - World famous, one of the most well known beaches in the world, and for a good reason - the scenery is spectacular. We had a tea with Marcelo (5 BRL ($1.26) and then tried some of the Brazilian local favorite comfort Biscoito Globo cassava snacks. Finally, another iconic Brazilian drink is the caipirinha (15 BRL ($3.79) made on the beach.Copacabana Beach - Next up on this Brazilian street food and attractions tour we stopped at the famous Copacabana Beach and had a coconut (6.50 BRL ($1.64) and continued on the Red Beach in Urca to get a good view of Sugarloaf Mountain (Pão de Açúcar).Bar Urca - Also in Urca, you’ll find Bar Urca, an old food and bar establishment that’s famous for serving empada de camarão (6.50 BRL ($1.64), shrimp filled pastries. Many people order and then sit on the edge of the water in the evening. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/RZAmnMsKWMtvuebFABar Gato de Botas - A Brazilian boteco is a bar and restaurant that serves small plates of food similar to tapas. The owner of Bar Gato de Botas is a legend and his plates of Brazilian food are delicious. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/efeUxoamaHa77vNR6Brazilian meat kebabs - Finally to end this incredible street food tour of Rio de Janeiro, we returned back to the same spot where we had breakfast, but in the evening, a different yet equally friendly man sets up selling Brazilian meat kebas and home cooked Brazilian food. When you order a kebab, you can get it stopped with cassava powder and drenched in hot sauce - it was so good. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA Sets up in the evening about 6 pm.Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful city and this Brazilian street food tour and attraction in Rio was amazing - the food, the people, the scenery.Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

Afterwards we continued to a family home who prepared us an outstanding Sri Lankan food meal - one of the best of the trip.We started the hike early in the morning, and already it was getting buy. But immediately as you arrive, you’ll feel a mystic auro to the rock and the entire site. The fortress and palace at the top of the rock was created and developed by King Kasyapa (477 – 495 CE). The mystery is that when he passed away, the empire collapsed and no one really knows what happened. Entrance ticket - $30 USD, a little expensive, but worth it, and a very cool experience.After we got down from the rock we then drove over to a Sri Lankan village where we met our host family and they had already started cooking an amazing home cooked meal, all in clay pots. One of the highlight dishes was deer meat, both dried and a fresh, cooked in a loads of different Sri Lankan spices. The food was incredible.Kotchi sambal - But probably my favorite part of the entire meal was watching her make kotchi sambal from scratch - a combination of fresh shredded mature coconut ground with chilies and onions, and a squeeze of lime juice. It was outstanding, and was so good I could have eaten it as a main dish rather than just a garnish side.It was an amazing day of Sri Lankan food and travel in Sigiriya!Thank you to everyone who generously hosted me in Sigiriya, for the delicious food, and to Ruzaina for arranging everything.

It was a quick trip to Pakistan, but we had a lot of fun filming and eating a different side of Pakistani food than I tried on my first trip.“Aala” - Just to clarify, this is a very popular expression in Pakistan and across the Indian subcontinent meaning “amazing,” or wow!Western Pakistani street food is common, and you’ll be surprised with the fusion of creations and creativity that you’ll find. For me, part of the joy of food is being able to interact with the cooks, see the food being prepared, and then eating - and Pakistan is as good as it gets. We started in Karachi, moved to Islamabad, and finishing this whirlwind tour in Lahore. Here are the restaurants and street food stalls we ate at in this video:Karachi, PakistanNursery Super Burgers - This place is amazing, one of my favorites. Their beef chapli burger bun kabab and their vegetable potato patty burgers and delicious. And don’t miss out on their chutney. Price - 70 PKR ($0.50) per burgerHanifia Hunter Beef - This is a famous place in Karachi, but for me it was a little on the plain side. Price - 160 PKR ($1.13) eachCloud Naan - Trendy yet delicious, Cloud Naan is set up like a pizza restaurant, but using naan as a base with a host of different ingredients. I loved the Philly Cheesesteak Naan. Price - about 500 PKR ($3.54) eachMr. Burger - Pakistan’s own fast food burger chain, Mr. Burger has a unique story, and their burger is definitely better than many fast food restaurants I’ve tried. Mr. Big combo - 450 PKR ($3.19)Biryani Of The Seas - To wrap up this street food tour in Karachi, we ate a seafood platter at Biryani of the Seas. Total price - 5,100 PKR ($36.10) totalIslamabad, PakistanNajeeb Spot - Famous in Islamabad for their Afghani Burger, this is a roll up of all things deep fried, and smothered in some chutney. It’s one of those 2 am foods. Price - about 200 PKR ($1.42) eachBurger Fest - Islamabad is known throughout Pakistan for their burgers, and Burger Fest is one of the best. Delicious burger. Beef Binda - 590 PKR ($4.18)Doka Mocca Restaurant - To wrap up Islamabad we ate the supreme fries and crazy panini at Doka Mocca.Lahore, PakistanLahore Broast - My first time to try Pakistani broast, which is essentially fried chicken. The ½ Chicken Broast was good, but I really liked the degi chargha, steamed chicken with spices. Price - 290 PKR ($2.05)Bun Plaster - Finally, another one of my favorites from this entire Western Pakistani street food fast food tour is the Lahore bun plaster. And yes, it does get its name from a wall.Yousaf Falooda Shop - Legendary in Lahore for their milk based desserts, we tried some of their specialties, plus a Doodh Pepsi - Milk Pepsi - which is common in Pakistan.And that wraps up this entire Western Pakistani street food tour! #Pakistan #PakistaniFood #PepsiThank you to:Pepsi Pakistan: https://www.instagram.com/pepsipakistan/Ali: https://www.instagram.com/alinhamdani/Joel: https://www.instagram.com/kru_joel/ZaidWatch my entire Pakistan Food series here: https://youtu.be/Xdya8eym9nMMUSIC: https://www.audionetwork.com/ and https://goo.gl/HwVjdoCAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNfMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: https://amzn.to/2tzcKmjFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology"

Please see my comments below with regards to reports the video was partially faked.  Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video (I posted this on all my social channels immediately after it happened)- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the “thieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn’t clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I’m really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that, I know my credibility is damaged but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I’ve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of “prank and like I mentioned in the video, it’s pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I’m especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn’t just taint the entire effort as “fake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I’ve built on my channel) and we’ve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I’m sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won’t happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

They rent high speed cameras at killer prices.  Hit them up.ELI20 version:  I answered why you want a large outlet area but not necessarily why it curves like that.  Anytime you have a sudden change in cross-sectional area in the horn you will get waves reflecting back at the source.  You don't want that because that is wasted energy that could have moved forward.  Even if it goes from a small cross-section to a larger, if you do it suddenly you get those wasted waves.  So you want the horn to basically be asymptotic at the exit so you never have a jump in discontinuity when it exits to the wide open air.  So a directors cone isn't as good as the curved shapes I showed because it still has the sudden change when it dumps into the open air.MUSIC-0:10- Arrow- Andrew Applepie - http://andrewapplepie.com/1:08- Dance- Danijel Zambo- https://danijel-zambo.bandcamp.com/2:00- Kalimba Jam- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/3:00- New shoes- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/7:30- Ceral Killa- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/8:47- Q- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/9:46 Too Happy to be cool by Notebreak- https://soundcloud.com/notebreak/dubstep-too-happy-to-be-coolSummary:  I made a huge horn and broke glass with it and explored why horns are shaped the way they are.MERCH-They are soft- https://teespring.com/stores/markroberPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub****************************************­I make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTubeFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTubeTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRoberINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/"

The Long Island native with hits on Dead and Home With You is of the more fetching pop singers to come along of late, and she's always upping her performance game. There's a powerful intimacy in her new track Hurts Like Hell. All the power that Justin Bieber heard when he came across Beer singing Etta James' At Last a few years has been refined, and it helps drive her super-catchy revenge song. We invited Beer in to give fans a stripped-down version of Hurts Like Hell, and with just a keyboard accompanying her, she made everything simmer.

Salting the potatoes ahead of time draws out some of their liquid and guarantees they’re well seasoned, but skip this step if you want some of that moisture when you take a bite!Check out the recipe here:10 large eggsFreshly ground black pepper2 tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more2 lb. Yukon Gold potatoes (about 6), peeled, cut into ¼” slices2 cups extra-virgin olive oil1 large onion, halved, thinly sliced lengthwiseBeat eggs, pepper, and 1 tsp. salt in a large bowl; set aside.Pat potatoes dry with a clean towel. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook potatoes, turning occasionally, until tender, 8–10 minutes (you can cover the skillet in the beginning; the potatoes should be white, not brown). Add onions in batches and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4–6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer potato mixture to a rimmed baking sheet and let cool slightly. Strain oil into a heatproof bowl. Wipe out skillet.Beat eggs again until frothy. Add potato mixture to eggs; season with 1 tsp. salt. Heat ¼ cup reserved oil in same skillet over medium-high (chill remaining oil and reserve for another use). Add egg mixture, arranging potatoes to submerge. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, making sure potatoes are submerged but mostly undisturbed, until eggs are almost set and top is still slightly runny, 15–20 minutes.Invert tortilla onto a large plate, then slide back into skillet browned side up. Cook over medium heat until golden on the bottom and cooked through, about 5 minutes more.Cut into wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature.*Do Ahead:* Tortilla can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.Still haven’t subscribed to Bon Appetit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPnABOUT BON APPÉTITCook with confidence using Bon Appetit’s kitchen tips, recipes, videos, and restaurant guides.

MAASAI HOMESTEAD (Manyatta): Cow’s Blood with Milk + Porridge ADDRESS: Kimana Sanctuary, Amboseli OPEN: N/ABack in the Maasai Homestead. We spent some time with the tribe and participated in a ritual that is both sacred and ordinary to the Maasai people. For decades, drinking cow’s blood was a way to make the most of cattle. They do not wish to slaughter an animal each week for meat so, in order to get nutrients such as iron and protein, they take some blood from the cow without killing it. This practice typically happens twice a month and on different cows in a herd. 🇰🇪 COW’S BLOOD WITH MILK: The blood is taken from the cow and then stirred rapidly to separate the coagulation. Fresh milk is also added to prevent clotting. It is then poured into cups and served as a complete meal. 🇰🇪 PORRIDGE: The milk is also used to make porridge. The flour is mixed with milk in bowl. Some water is brought to a boil in a sufuria and the mixture is added while stirring continuously as it boils. 💸PRICE: N/A- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -💬COME SAY HI:INSTAGRAM » http://bit.ly/BestEverInstagram (@besteverfoodreviewshow)FACEBOOK » http://bit.ly/BEFRSFacebook💗SUPPORT OUR MISSION: Patreon is a platform that allows people to support creators on a recurring basis.

I’ve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.Don’t forget to subscribe to Best Ever Food Review Show, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -🎬CREDITS:DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY » Bret HamiltonCAMERA OPERATOR » Nguyễn Tân KhảiVIDEO EDITOR » Sonny SideCOLOR & MASTER » Quí NguyễnPRODUCER » Liz PetersonFor business inquiries, please email: team.befrs@gmail.com"

Aside from a desire to “change the rap game” as he put it on Twitter, the Florida native has a knack for crafting nuanced rhymes while keeping an eye on goal of mainstream success. Those two ideas don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Take his latest, “CLOUT COBAIN | CLOUT CO13A1N,” for example. For Vevo’s hip-hop performance series, we captured the upstart rapper in church on Manhattan's Upper West Side, waxing philosophically about the chase for mass appeal. The track is an early offering from his forthcoming project, ‘TA1300.’ Give it a listen and level up.

When the virus hit, The Division, a unit of civilian sleeper agents, was activated as the last line of defense. Since then, Division agents have been fighting relentlessly to save what remains.For The Division, the stakes are higher than ever. Washington, D.C. – the most heavily protected city on earth – is at risk, leaving the entire nation on the brink of collapse. If Washington, D.C., is lost, then the nation falls. As a Division agent who has been in the field for seven months, you and your team are the last hope to stop the fall of society after the pandemic collapse.Developed by Ubisoft Massive and the same teams that brought you Tom Clancy’s The Division®, Tom Clancy’s The Division® 2 is an online open world, action shooter RPG experience set in a collapsing and fractured Washington, D.C. This rich new setting combines a wide variety of beautiful, iconic, and realistic environments where the player will experience the series’ trademark for authenticity in world building, rich RPG systems, and fast-paced action like never before. Play solo or co-op with a team of up to four players to complete a wide range of activities, from the main campaign and adversarial PvP matches to the Dark Zone – where anything can happen.A TRANSFORMED WASHINGTON, D.C.In the wake of the virus, storms, flooding, and subsequent chaos have radically transformed Washington, D.C. Explore a living open world full of diverse environments, from flooded urban areas to historic sites and landmarks, during one of the hottest summers in history. The streets have been overrun with enemy factions, each with its own agenda and each vying for control of DC. It will be up to you to liberate the city and protect what remains of society.BEST-IN-CLASS ENDGAME EXPERIENCETom Clancy’s The Division 2 was built with an “endgame-first” mentality, ensuring players always have access to fresh, unique, and diverse activities long after completing the main campaign. Tom Clancy’s The Division 2’s endgame will introduce brand new challenges and progression systems, unique twists and surprises, and for the first time, raids. Players will also be able to access a wealth of post-launch content, including a full year of free additional story-driven missions, map expansions, and gameplay modes.REVAMPED PLAYER PROGRESSION AND NEW SPECIALIZATIONSAfter completing the main campaign, gain access to new specializations such as demolitionist, sharpshooter, and survivalist. Each specialization will open up an entire new progression system with new skills, mods, and unique talents to acquire and maximize your agent efficiency in your chosen role.DYNAMIC LIVING WORLDCivilians and enemy factions are constantly striving to survive, vying for necessities such as food, medicine, and ammunition. As the factions face off against each other in a ravaged DC, they will fight to seize control of resources and locations – and for their very survival. The various needs and motivations from each faction will collide, triggering different encounters between enemy and friendly factions, civilians, and ultimately you as an Agent, creating a dynamic living world full of surprises.UNITE THE CIVILIANSCivilians have banded together in settlements to rebuild their society, but their very existence is threatened. Work closely with them to keep them safe and in turn, they will come to your aid and provide supplies and assistance to build up your base of operations, giving a deeper meaning to the people and the world around you.A RENEWED DARK ZONE EXPERIENCEThe Dark Zone is an untamed area of the map with some of the best loot in the game. The Dark Zone is also the most dangerous area in the game, where fear, betrayal, and tension are high, as any other agent can turn against you and steal your hard-earned loot. In Tom Clancy’s The Division 2, this playground was designed to provide a fair and exciting experience to all players, regardless of their level of progression.The Division 2: Operation Dark Hours – How to Get Raid Ready | Ubisoft [NA]http://www.youtube.com/UbisoftNA"

I'm always struggling what to call these haha. ANYWAY. It's another fun(?) kind of bake with me type of videos. Where I have no clue what I'm doing and we just laugh at my cluelessness together. I am not the best at baking, but I try and have fun. Try not to get triggered.This time I made (not sure if it's baking if you don' use an oven lol) my dessert taco squishy. If you guys like this i will do more of course.

Today, I'm gonna bring you guys along with me to paint over my old, boring cloth organizers. They're pretty plain and white and since I'm going for a very colorful look in my new art room, I thought I could give them a little makeover.I'm in the process of decorating my whole art room, so if you like this video, I may do more like this.These are the typical Ikea cube shelves that everyone and their mother has. I felt like this was something good to share with everyone because I've never seen anyone else do this, and I think it is a pretty easy way to put a personal touch on a room.Obviously you wouldn't have to do this as obnoxiously as me lol. You could be more subdued and classy with it. Or use stencils and whatnot if you don't want to free-hand it.TIPS:Fabric paint works really great on these, but if you can’t find fabric paint, make sure you at least use a paint that is flexible so that it doesn’t crack when you're dragging these in and out of the shelves. Probably not best to use something like acrylic paint. Unless you combine it with a fabric medium.WHAT YOU NEED:1. Cube Shelf  (I’m using the Kallax Shelf from Ikea)2. Cloth box insert (or you can use wooden bins)3. Fabric Paint (switch with acrylic paint if using wooden bins)Im thinking about how to decorate the remaining 4. Not sure if I should do them in the same theme, a different theme or STORAGE BINS (affiliate link):https://amzn.to/2JfiPh4VIDEO FACTS:–If you notice on my very “MESSY” plan, I was going to do metallic accents….obviously I changed my mind about that. I just decided I didn’t want that look…..–I wanted them to each be unique in the own way, but unify them with color. they all have a light rainbow, a dark rainbow and white accents.–I decided not to paint the sides, back or inside of the boxes (only the front) because1. Those areas aren’t visible unless the bin is open and 2. I didn’t want the paint on the outside to stick to the shelf___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

I took care of the soft n slo cat with the tail, a unicorn (i mean, alicorn ugh) hugging on the moon, and a little surprise resident for my cottage from last episode (as promised). I had some struggles as usual, but I think overall they came out well. Do you like them?!?!?!Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...VIDEO FACTS:–I did the whole showing while editing thing for the first time. I have recently been using clips of my face from old videos to give facial reactions but I got tired of sifting through old footage, so i just quickly filmed those bits on my computer. not sure how i feel about it yet, or if it'll be a thing. i know a lot of other youtubers are doing that now also, so ehhh idk. after reading the comments, some people seemed to like it, some people didnt. we'll see! –Apparently having a male calico cat is super rare. A lot of people are saying it's impossible in the comments, BUT i looked it up and actually its just uncommon. About 1 in 3,000 calico cats are male. So he's jus special then haha :)–based on the comments, the bear in the bunny costume is a koala? I would have never guessed that in a million years. How are those koala ears!?!? And why is there a rim around the face as if its wearing a costume?! I have no clue. but a lot of ya'll are saying it, so I guess it is a koala. sure?? ________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. 8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit. I spend multiple weeks working on them (in combination with my other videos) so it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my art and craft videos as well ☺___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/CONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Through Gary I met George Lowden and he started making my tour guitars for me, which were amazing both on stage and in the studio   We have been talking for years about trying to make a guitar that was as amazing as a Lowden but in a price point that was the same as the regular guitar companies, and also be made in Ireland. We never thought it was possible, but George and his team managed it   I’m so honoured to launch our new guitar brand, Sheeran guitars by Lowden.

What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYSthis channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYsWhen Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have four children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly, Alessia Saccone Joly and Andrea Saccone Joly they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.Using an Affiliate link means that we receive a percentage of the revenue made from purchasing products through this link.

Despite this terminal diagnosis he's still fighting to stay alive.Harry’s parents, Charlotte and James, set up Harry’s Giant Pledge working with giantpledge.com and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. Their aim is to raise money for research into Ewing’s Sarcoma and other childhood cancers to ensure children like Harry have a better chance of surviving. Harry was diagnosed with cancer on 2 August 2018 when a routine scan on a small lump showed a tumour the size of a large baked potato inside Harry’s right chest. Harry was 4.In the space of a few minutes on that hot sunny afternoon the Shaw Family's life was changed forever.Follow us on Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/jonathanjolyhttps://www.instagram.com/annasaccone1 YEAR AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yefx1obrZIw2 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wdqjxQi7TA&t=31s3 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_BAXcwVDOw4 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_xMOBUHOoU5 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFBhH3d806c6 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C2K_2EwmgM7 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BACglxXJ9Jc8 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgouzA5GUSUBelow are a couple affiliate links for products that we’re always using and asked about…Chicco NEXT2ME Crib - https://amzn.to/2uj1HOjHandbag Organiser - https://amzn.to/2lJDJrDGH5 Camera - https://amzn.to/2kdUyKBG7X Camera - https://amzn.to/2kbvHXGAnker PowerWave Wireless Charger - https://amzn.to/2HXU1pzCoffee Machine - https://amzn.to/2kaRvTdStokke Tripp High Chair - https://amzn.to/2kbYqeRStair Gate - https://amzn.to/2s1yFSbAlessia's Baby Walker - https://amzn.to/2GBZQZ4Car Seats - https://amzn.to/2katN9AThe Great Cat Nap - https://amzn.to/2rYI3WLHydrateM8 Water Bottle - https://amzn.to/2GE8qqlNume Curling Wand - https://amzn.to/2s0vtGuAnna's Mac Lipstick (Honey Love) - https://amzn.to/2rVIJvUWatch our Proposal videohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQ4Vu02HEsWatch our wedding videohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UYOQg-aJZwWatch the birth of our baby girl (Emilia)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrNulUx7xcWatch the birth of our baby boy (Eduardo)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqU3wGXnV3EWatch the birth of our baby girl (Alessia)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVoGKXUE-8k&tWatch the birth of our baby boy (Andrea)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE6pLbIXHoAWatch the birth of our Maltese Puppieshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ex4S4uJMvgEverything you wanted to know about me before the videoshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnKVnFlRkAkFriendliest Friends Channel http://www.youtube.com/friendliestfriendsJonathan's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/jonathanjolyAnna's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/thestylediet- Add Jonathan on Snapchat: sacconejolys- Add Anna on Snapchat: asacconejoly- Follow Jonathan on Instagram: http://instagram.com/jonathanjoly- Follow Anna on Instagram: http://instagram.com/annasacconeFollow us on TWITTERhttp://www.twitter.com/jonathanjolyhttp://www.twitter.com/annasacconeJoin us on FACEBOOKhttps://www.facebook.com/JonathanPatrickJolyCheck out our INSTAGRAM pictureshttp://instagram.com/jonathanjolyhttp://instagram.com/annasaccone*******************************Short History of SACCONEJOLYsIn 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos.
