Please see my comments below with regards to reports the video was partially faked.  Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video (I posted this on all my social channels immediately after it happened)- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the “thieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn’t clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I’m really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that, I know my credibility is damaged but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I’ve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of “prank and like I mentioned in the video, it’s pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I’m especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn’t just taint the entire effort as “fake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I’ve built on my channel) and we’ve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I’m sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won’t happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

They rent high speed cameras at killer prices.  Hit them up.ELI20 version:  I answered why you want a large outlet area but not necessarily why it curves like that.  Anytime you have a sudden change in cross-sectional area in the horn you will get waves reflecting back at the source.  You don't want that because that is wasted energy that could have moved forward.  Even if it goes from a small cross-section to a larger, if you do it suddenly you get those wasted waves.  So you want the horn to basically be asymptotic at the exit so you never have a jump in discontinuity when it exits to the wide open air.  So a directors cone isn't as good as the curved shapes I showed because it still has the sudden change when it dumps into the open air.MUSIC-0:10- Arrow- Andrew Applepie - http://andrewapplepie.com/1:08- Dance- Danijel Zambo- https://danijel-zambo.bandcamp.com/2:00- Kalimba Jam- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/3:00- New shoes- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/7:30- Ceral Killa- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/8:47- Q- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/9:46 Too Happy to be cool by Notebreak- https://soundcloud.com/notebreak/dubstep-too-happy-to-be-coolSummary:  I made a huge horn and broke glass with it and explored why horns are shaped the way they are.MERCH-They are soft- https://teespring.com/stores/markroberPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub****************************************­I make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTubeFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTubeTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRoberINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/"

Audiences were divided over both of the seminal battles in season 8: the Battle of King’s Landing (episode 5, “The Bells”) and the Battle of Winterfell (episode 3, “The Long Night”). We compare these two landmark war sequences and analyze what worked — and what didn’t — in each. And we answer the question of which one was better, making a strong case for the Battle of Winterfell. Here’s why the clash between the Living and the Dead at Winterfell far surpassed Daenerys’s attack on King’s Landing — in terms of both plot and execution.MORE GAME OF THRONES CONTENT:81 Details In 'Game Of Thrones' Season 8 You Might Have Missedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYMNMa2epFoHow 'Game Of Thrones' Created The Most Epic Battle Scene In TV Historyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKqdK1yavu416 Clues Foreshadowing Arya’s Big Moment In ‘Game Of Thrones’ Season 8 Episode 3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DthX08zjLo------------------------------------------------------#GameOfThrones #GoT #INSIDERINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

Bran, Sansa, and Arya Stark take center stage at the end of season 8 and we have to think that Ned Stark’s influence guided these characters.The series finale of Game of Thrones wasn’t perfect, but it did provide a satisfying end. King Bran the Broken was crowned, and his sister Sansa reigns as Queen in the independent Kingdom of the North. Arya Stark leaves behind a life of death to reclaim her humanity sailing to find out what’s west of Westeros. The seven kingdoms is now the six kingdoms and King Bran has a small council filled with fan favorite characters.While Daenerys’ story took a tragic turn, we are left feeling that the kingdoms of Westeros could turn out better as a result. Jon Snow was reunited with his direwolf Ghost, and his watch begins again at Castle Black. Tyrion is Hand of the King, Brienne is captain of the King’s guard, Bronn is master of coin, Davos Seaworth is master of ships, and Samwell Tarly is the Grandmaester of King’s Landing. The characters are all changed from their journeys, but the realm is changed for the better because they made them. The series finale of Game of Thrones is not only the end of Season 8, but the end of an era.What did you think about Game of Thrones season 8 episode 6, and how did you think it stacks up as a series finale?  What do you think about the characters’ endings and what they mean for the ending of George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire?

Please Subscribe now! - http://bit.ly/PetePeppersHBO’s Game of Thrones Season 8 has come to its end and Episode 6 will be the series finale of this cultural phenomenon. In season 8 we have seen a lot of bitter turns, and fans are wondering how will the ending turn out to be bittersweet.Since Daenerys’ story had a turn that many fans didn’t see coming it’s looking like her end will be of the bitter variety. While she isn’t likely to survive the series she may inadvertently insured that the people of Westeros will never have to live under the rule of tyrants. Jon Snow may have to do the unthinkable in killing Daenerys, but he will bring balance to the realm by ending the existential threats of Ice and the White Walkers, and Fire from Daenerys and her dragons.We expect that Game of Thrones s8 episode 6 will have an epilogue to show us our favorite secondary characters after the wars are over. We guess that characters like Sam and Gilly, Arya, Sansa, and the Starks will have happy endings that come at great cost. Low born characters like Gendry, Davos, Bronn, and Tormund should live on to lead better lives. The smallfolk and people of Westeros will turn out to be the big winners of the story after suffering so much from the persistent wars.

Now that we’ve reached the ending of Game of Thrones we are left guessing how are favorite GoT characters’ stories will end. We don’t who will survive episode 6, and we don’t know who will be sitting on the Iron Throne at the end or if anyone will. Daenerys has taken King’s Landing but she did it in a way that will be hard for Jon Snow and Tyrion to approve of. This may mean that Dany will die before season 8 concludes.Since we don’t have much promotional material for Game of Thrones s8 episode 6 we have to look back at episode 5 for clues. We know directly after the sacking of King’s Landing that Jon, Davos, Tyrion, and Arya Stark are all in the city. Daenerys has taken control and her Dothraki and Unsullied made it through the battle with few casualties.

Fans have worried she might go Mad Queen in GoT s8 e5 for a while. Please Subscribe now! - http://bit.ly/PetePeppersDaenerys Targaryen is a character that some fans really love and some fans actually hate. Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 4 we saw Dany lose nearly everything as she headed south to press her claim for the Iron Throne. After losing Jorah in the Long Night, she lost her dragon Rhaegal, and her closest adviser and friend Missandei. Cersei executed her right in front of Daenerys and this seems to have put her on a destructive path.In Game of Thrones season 8 episode 5 fans fear that Daenerys may lose her grip and burn King’s Landing to the ground. This is worrisome because the Queen has brought innocent civilians inside the Red Keep to act as human shields. Because Daenerys’ father Aerys II went crazy fans have had theories of Dany following the same path and becoming the mad queen. While this ending seemed unlikely so has and ending that sees Daenerys sit on the Iron Throne to rule the Seven Kingdoms. It’s always been difficult to figure how her story might end. With only two episodes of Game of Thrones left in its final season, we will probably get answers in episode 5. Fans who love Daenerys may not be happy with her ending, and may find it difficult to make sense of her story.What did you think will happen in Game of Thrones season 8 episode 5, and who do you think will control King’s Landing and the Iron Throne by the end?

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content.

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com Colorful Animation 4 SeaweedAnd from Kevin MacLeod Marty Gots a PlanThis is an educational video about the science of water quality."

It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.Filming by Raquel Nuno"

Which movie's sins should we expose next?!Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/CinemaSins Podcast: https://soundcloud.com/cinemasins TVSins: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe4bOvc1mYxFcQ5xPb9Zmow MusicVideoSins: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBq8oBRVTsMpjWiHfjJpDw Twitters...Jeremy: http://twitter.com/cinemasins Barrett: http://twitter.com/musicvideosins Aaron: http://twitter.com/aarondicer Jonathan: http://twitter.com/samloomis13 Merch: http://districtlines.com/cinemasins Subreddit: http://reddit.com/r/cinemasins Website: http://cinemasins.com SinCast Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/SinCastCinemaSins"

Both redefining and transcending the genre, “IT” became part of the cultural zeitgeist as well as the highest-grossing horror film of all time.Because every 27 years evil revisits the town of Derry, Maine, “It Chapter Two” brings the characters—who’ve long since gone their separate ways—back together as adults, nearly three decades after the events of the first film.  Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (“Zero Dark Thirty,” “Mama”) stars as Beverly, James McAvoy (“Split,” upcoming “Glass”) as Bill, Bill Hader (HBO’s “Barry,” “The Skeleton Twins”) as Richie, Isaiah Mustafa (TV’s “Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments”) as Mike, Jay Ryan (TV’s “Mary Kills People”) as Ben, James Ransone (HBO’s “The Wire”) as Eddie, and Andy Bean (“Allegiant,” Starz’ “Power”) as Stanley.  Reprising their roles as the original members of the Losers Club are Jaeden Martell as Bill, Wyatt Oleff as Stanley, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie, Finn Wolfhard as Richie, Sophia Lillis as Beverly, Chosen Jacobs as Mike, and Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben.  Bill Skarsgård returns in the seminal role of Pennywise.  Muschietti directed the film from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman (“IT,” “Annabelle: Creation”) based on the novel IT by Stephen King.  Barbara Muschietti, Dan Lin and Roy Lee produced the film, with Marty Ewing, Seth Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg serving as the executive producers.The behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Checco Varese (“The 33”), Oscar-winning production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“The Shape of Water”), editor Jason Ballantine (“IT,” “Mad Max: Fury Road”), and Oscar-nominated costume designer Luis Sequeira (“The Shape of Water,” “Mama”).  The music is by Benjamin Wallfisch (“Shazam!,” “Blade Runner 2049,” “IT”). New Line Cinema presents, a Vertigo Entertainment/Rideback Production, an Andy Muschietti film, “It Chapter Two.”  The film is slated for release in theaters and IMAX on September 6, 2019 and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

Amidst the racial and economic turmoil of the times, he writes poetry as a means to escape the intolerance of his hometown and the inflexibility of his traditional father.  But when a classmate introduces him to the music of “the Boss,” Javed sees parallels to his working-class life in Springsteen’s powerful lyrics.  As Javed discovers a cathartic outlet for his own pent-up dreams, he also begins to find the courage to express himself in his own unique voice.Based on Sarfraz Manzoor’s acclaimed memoir Greetings from Bury Park, “Blinded by the Light” is a joyful story of courage, love, hope, family and the unique ability of music to lift the human spirit.Chadha directed and produced the film, which was written by Manzoor, Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges.  The story is underscored by the music and poetic lyrics of Springsteen, who gave Chadha his blessing from the film’s inception.“Blinded by the Light” stars Viveik Kalra, Hayley Atwell, Rob Brydon, Kulvinder Ghir, Nell Williams, Dean-Charles Chapman, and Aaron Phagura.  The film was directed by Gurinder Chadha from a screenplay by Sarfraz Manzoor, Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges.  Jane Barclay, Chadha, and Jamal Daniel produced the film.

When the virus hit, The Division, a unit of civilian sleeper agents, was activated as the last line of defense. Since then, Division agents have been fighting relentlessly to save what remains.For The Division, the stakes are higher than ever. Washington, D.C. – the most heavily protected city on earth – is at risk, leaving the entire nation on the brink of collapse. If Washington, D.C., is lost, then the nation falls. As a Division agent who has been in the field for seven months, you and your team are the last hope to stop the fall of society after the pandemic collapse.Developed by Ubisoft Massive and the same teams that brought you Tom Clancy’s The Division®, Tom Clancy’s The Division® 2 is an online open world, action shooter RPG experience set in a collapsing and fractured Washington, D.C. This rich new setting combines a wide variety of beautiful, iconic, and realistic environments where the player will experience the series’ trademark for authenticity in world building, rich RPG systems, and fast-paced action like never before. Play solo or co-op with a team of up to four players to complete a wide range of activities, from the main campaign and adversarial PvP matches to the Dark Zone – where anything can happen.A TRANSFORMED WASHINGTON, D.C.In the wake of the virus, storms, flooding, and subsequent chaos have radically transformed Washington, D.C. Explore a living open world full of diverse environments, from flooded urban areas to historic sites and landmarks, during one of the hottest summers in history. The streets have been overrun with enemy factions, each with its own agenda and each vying for control of DC. It will be up to you to liberate the city and protect what remains of society.BEST-IN-CLASS ENDGAME EXPERIENCETom Clancy’s The Division 2 was built with an “endgame-first” mentality, ensuring players always have access to fresh, unique, and diverse activities long after completing the main campaign. Tom Clancy’s The Division 2’s endgame will introduce brand new challenges and progression systems, unique twists and surprises, and for the first time, raids. Players will also be able to access a wealth of post-launch content, including a full year of free additional story-driven missions, map expansions, and gameplay modes.REVAMPED PLAYER PROGRESSION AND NEW SPECIALIZATIONSAfter completing the main campaign, gain access to new specializations such as demolitionist, sharpshooter, and survivalist. Each specialization will open up an entire new progression system with new skills, mods, and unique talents to acquire and maximize your agent efficiency in your chosen role.DYNAMIC LIVING WORLDCivilians and enemy factions are constantly striving to survive, vying for necessities such as food, medicine, and ammunition. As the factions face off against each other in a ravaged DC, they will fight to seize control of resources and locations – and for their very survival. The various needs and motivations from each faction will collide, triggering different encounters between enemy and friendly factions, civilians, and ultimately you as an Agent, creating a dynamic living world full of surprises.UNITE THE CIVILIANSCivilians have banded together in settlements to rebuild their society, but their very existence is threatened. Work closely with them to keep them safe and in turn, they will come to your aid and provide supplies and assistance to build up your base of operations, giving a deeper meaning to the people and the world around you.A RENEWED DARK ZONE EXPERIENCEThe Dark Zone is an untamed area of the map with some of the best loot in the game. The Dark Zone is also the most dangerous area in the game, where fear, betrayal, and tension are high, as any other agent can turn against you and steal your hard-earned loot. In Tom Clancy’s The Division 2, this playground was designed to provide a fair and exciting experience to all players, regardless of their level of progression.The Division 2: State of the Game #121 - 22 May 2019 | Ubisoft [NA]http://www.youtube.com/UbisoftNA"

Today we went on a short hike to the famous Telegraph rock, and then ate an incredible Brazilian seafood meal. #Brazil #RiodeJaneiro #foodOysters - It was about an hour drive from the center of Rio, and we arrived to the oyster man - a little stall where a man has been selling oysters since Guilherme was a child. His oysters were small, but they were flavorful, with just a squeeze of lime. Perfect way to begin this Brazilian food day. Price - 12 for 10 BRL ($2.50)Pedra Do Telégrafo - We then drove to a small beach town and climbed up the hill to a point known as Pedra Do Telégrafo, or Telegraph rock. It’s most famou now because of social media, and people take a photo in a way that it looks like they are dangling from a rock cliff. The views are spectacular and well worth climbing when you’re in Rio.Gugut Restaurante - Located in Vargem Grande neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, we met up with Marcelo to eat a massive Brazilian seafood meal, especially dishes from the Espirito Santo state of Brazil.Moqueca - There are two versions of this amazing dish, a fish stew, one from Espirito Santo and the other from Bahia (stay tuned for Bahia coming soon). He added in tomatoes, onions, and cilantro, followed by fish. It was simple but delicious, relying on the fresh fish to really made it special. Gugut Restaurant is not cheap, but they serve top notch seafood, great quality, and very fresh. All the food was delicious. Total price - 400 BRL ($100.32)And that completes this Brazilian seafood and hike in Rio de Janeiro, another wonderful day in Brazil.Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

But to be honest I had never been to any outside of Brazil - and there was no better place to have my first Brazilian meat churrascaria experience than in Brazil.Churrascaria Palace (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/xtKKEisbcvWv9P8m6) - We chose to go to Churrascaria Palace, a meat restaurant located in Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro. As soon as I stepped into the restaurant, I could smell the aroma of the roasting meats, and it was a great upscale, yet laid back atmosphere, with live music.Chef Silva took care of us from the moment we stepped in and first showed us the kitchen where the meats were being roasted. It’s very interesting to learn about the different cuts of meat that they use in Brazil, which are unique to Brazil. One of the unique and beloved types of meat is cupim, which comes from the beef hump from Zebu cattle.Once Chef Silva started bringing us meats, he did not joke around - the Brazilian steakhouse bbq meats started flowing non stop. A Brazilian steakhouse bbq is typically served Rodízio, meaning it’s all you can eat, but the meat is not served buffet style, but rather it’s served to you at your plate. They slice it in front of you, and then you use your tongs to grab the meat as its sliced in front of you.Chef Silva served us 14 types of meat, including some Amazon river fish. He told us he only served us the premium cuts, and there were many other less premium cuts that we were too full to even try.Brazilian food is often heavy on the meat, and there’s no better way to experience Brazilian meat than with a churrascaria!Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

There are estimates of as many as 1,000 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many of the favelas in Rio de Janeiro are full cities within themselves, where nearly everything is available.It’s without a doubt that a lot of crime and organized underground criminal activity happens and is controlled in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. However, favelas across Brazil are home to some of the most hard working, friendly, happy, and creative people in Brazil as well. So in this video my goal was to meet and to highlight some of the amazing people that call favelas home. Rocinha - The first favela we visited was Rocinha, the biggest favela in Rio, one of the biggest in Brazil. We met up with Guilherme who took us on a walking tour to some viewpoints and to some Brazilian food places.Sabor da Roça - The most well known little snack shop on this street in Rocinha, we stopped for a coxinha, one of the top Brazilian food snacks. It was packed with chicken and with some hot sauce it was amazing. Price -  2.5 BRL ($0.63)For lunch we stopped at an alleyway restaurant in Rocinha, where he cooked up a lunch set included beef ribs, cassava, pasta, rice, and beans. It was simple, but delicious and hearty.Price - 10 BRL ($2.52)Morro da Providência - Favela number two is one of the first favelas of Rio and located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, near the port and up on a hill on the side of the cliff. We met up with Jura, who is an absolute Brazilian food cooking legend and an amazing person.One of Jura’s most famous dishes is nhoque de camarão, an Italian but Brazilian potato noodles in Jura’s own creation sauce of shrimp and coconut milk. It was simply outstanding, all made from scratch.But the dish I was most interested in eating and which Jura expertly cooked, again from scratch was her feijoada - often considered the national dish of Brazil, and one of my personal favorite foods of Brazil as well - there are few dishes of the world more comforting than beans and pig parts with rice. When you’re in Brazil, you can eat feijoada at many restaurants, but home-cooked is by far the best.Thank you Jura and Elena!!This was one of the best days I had in Brazil in terms of learning, meeting people, and food, and it’s an experience and memories I’ll never forget. You hear a lot of the negative that comes out of favelas in Brazil, and it is true. However, the positive side and the amazing people, are not often recognized, and it was truly memorable to see and learn about this side of hope in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

Finally, the time has come. In this Brazilian street food tour in Rio de Janeiro, we’ll go to eat some of the best street food snacks and dishes, some hole in the wall style Brazilian food restaurants, and also visit some of the most unbelievable and gorgeous sights and attractions in Rio de Janeiro. It’s one of the most beautiful cities I’ve ever visited.Here’s the Brazilian food and things we did:Mineiro, Sausage Sandwich - 5 BRL ($1.26) - For Brazilian breakfast we headed to Mineiro for his neighborhood grilled sausage sandwich, topped with his house made aioli dressing, cheese, and lettuce, and his own home-made chili sauce. He’s not only an amazing guy, but his sausage sandwich is outstanding. When you’re in Rio de Janeiro, you don’t want to miss it. Located just outside Siqueira Campos MRT Metro station (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA), sets up in the morning about 7 am.Trem do Corcovado - 65 BRL ($16.44) - Christ the Redeemer - I pre-bought tickets online for the tram, so when we arrived we just picked up and printed the tickets. The tram took about 20 minutes and Christ The Redeemer at the top was breathtaking.Selaron Steps - Another attraction in Rio de Janeiro that I wasn’t going to miss was the Selaron Steps, created by Chilean artist Selaron. They are so cool and so iconic.Lunch at Bar Rex - For some seriously meaty Brazilian food, Bar Rex is the spot. They serve an major selection of drinks, but they also specialize in food like roasted chicken, sausages, and the oxtail. The food was outstanding, and the owners are just so cool. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/ZeshTp5D3ggLoGx87Ipanema Beach - World famous, one of the most well known beaches in the world, and for a good reason - the scenery is spectacular. We had a tea with Marcelo (5 BRL ($1.26) and then tried some of the Brazilian local favorite comfort Biscoito Globo cassava snacks. Finally, another iconic Brazilian drink is the caipirinha (15 BRL ($3.79) made on the beach.Copacabana Beach - Next up on this Brazilian street food and attractions tour we stopped at the famous Copacabana Beach and had a coconut (6.50 BRL ($1.64) and continued on the Red Beach in Urca to get a good view of Sugarloaf Mountain (Pão de Açúcar).Bar Urca - Also in Urca, you’ll find Bar Urca, an old food and bar establishment that’s famous for serving empada de camarão (6.50 BRL ($1.64), shrimp filled pastries. Many people order and then sit on the edge of the water in the evening. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/RZAmnMsKWMtvuebFABar Gato de Botas - A Brazilian boteco is a bar and restaurant that serves small plates of food similar to tapas. The owner of Bar Gato de Botas is a legend and his plates of Brazilian food are delicious. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/efeUxoamaHa77vNR6Brazilian meat kebabs - Finally to end this incredible street food tour of Rio de Janeiro, we returned back to the same spot where we had breakfast, but in the evening, a different yet equally friendly man sets up selling Brazilian meat kebas and home cooked Brazilian food. When you order a kebab, you can get it stopped with cassava powder and drenched in hot sauce - it was so good.

Afterwards we continued to a family home who prepared us an outstanding Sri Lankan food meal - one of the best of the trip.We started the hike early in the morning, and already it was getting buy. But immediately as you arrive, you’ll feel a mystic auro to the rock and the entire site. The fortress and palace at the top of the rock was created and developed by King Kasyapa (477 – 495 CE). The mystery is that when he passed away, the empire collapsed and no one really knows what happened. Entrance ticket - $30 USD, a little expensive, but worth it, and a very cool experience.After we got down from the rock we then drove over to a Sri Lankan village where we met our host family and they had already started cooking an amazing home cooked meal, all in clay pots. One of the highlight dishes was deer meat, both dried and a fresh, cooked in a loads of different Sri Lankan spices. The food was incredible.Kotchi sambal - But probably my favorite part of the entire meal was watching her make kotchi sambal from scratch - a combination of fresh shredded mature coconut ground with chilies and onions, and a squeeze of lime juice. It was outstanding, and was so good I could have eaten it as a main dish rather than just a garnish side.It was an amazing day of Sri Lankan food and travel in Sigiriya!Thank you to everyone who generously hosted me in Sigiriya, for the delicious food, and to Ruzaina for arranging everything.

We fix Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid, Arsenal, Manchester United and Real Madrid - talking through where the holes in their squads are, the budgets they have to work with, and the players they can afford to fill them - taking a deep dive into transfer insight and tactical sense in equal measure.In this week's Hot Takes, we take a look at how a 4th to 7th playoff series for the last Champions League spot could make the Premier League more exciting, if Jose Mourinho is the right man to take the vacant Juventus hot seat and whether Frank Lampard is in fact any good at management. Bleacher Roulette takes on more fun and games as we talk about whether we'd prefer the career of Dani Alves or Philipp Lahm, if we'd prefer to score a cup final winner as a first minute screamer or a last minute tap-in, and which teams are most fun to play with on FIFA and Football Manager."

It seems that even from his earlier days there existed darkness within him, a darkness that only grew with time. I believe Euron is a psychopath. According to the dictionary, psychopathy is defined by impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits. The word psychopath does not imply delusional thought or irrational action. Euron thinks extremely highly of himself and is incapable of empathizing with other people. And now he seeks final Ascension. The Horn, Victarion, and Holy Men all seem key to Euron’s Grand Plan.Thanks for watching!Cover Art by: Bella Bergolts: https://bergolts.artstation.com/projects/OV6dwPlease consider supporting this channel on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ideasoficeandfireThe Book I helped write: https://www.amazon.com/Thrones-Effect-HBOs-Conquered-Culture/dp/0998029947/ref=sr_1_1?crid=A2RMTG1N5WWR&keywords=the+thrones+effect&qid=1558142871&s=gateway&sprefix=thrones+eff%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRELike me on Facebook!: https://www.facebook.com/IOIAFFeel free to leave a comment like and subscribe!Thanks For Watching!"

Becoming an organ donor is the first heroic step to creating this legacy – the gift of life. Live Life Give Life is committed to celebrating organ donation and inspiring the individual to leave a positive legacy that lasts for generations. Our goal is to motivate everyone in the UK to register as an organ donor. We want people from all walks of life to sign-up to the NHS Organ Donor Register, and to speak-up and share the decision they’ve made.Live Life Give Life. Make it your legacy.https://www.livelifegivelife.org.uk Jim Lynskey works closely with the donor awareness site Save9Lives to raise people’s awareness and understanding of organ donation. “I’ve been aiming to raise awareness for organ donation with Save9Lives (https://www.save9lives.com/) which works in partnership with The NHS. I formed the campaign when I was transplant listed back in 2015 - it was the fact that one organ donor can potentially save 9 people which really stuck with me amongst the sobering statistics of current donor shortages in the UK. I’ve been unable to access a new heart so far, so I’m now being kept alive with an electric heart pump. I thought I would drive the frustrated energy associated with my experiences into this vibrant Save9Lives campaign message, and I’ve since received some very humbling support from many within the music industry. As a fan, it’s a huge honour to work with Lewis alongside his incredible Someone You Loved video. Register as an organ donor at Save9Lives (https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/register-to-donate/?campaign=2462) will allow us to track how many people have been inspired by Lewis’ powerful message illustrated in his video release. I’m sure I speak on behalf of the 6000+ patents awaiting a transplant today in saying thank you for raising such vital awareness, in celebration of Someone You Loved”——————————————————Lyrics I’m going under and this time I fear there’s no one to save meThis all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazyI need somebody to healsomebody to knowsomebody to havesomebody to holdIt’s easy to saybut it’s never the sameI guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the painNow the day bleeds, into nightfalland you’re not here, to get me through it allI let my guard down and then you pulled the rugI was getting kinda used to being someone you lovedI’m going under and this time I fear there’s no one to turn toThis all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without youNow I need somebody to know somebody to heal somebody to have just to know how it feelsIt’s easy to saybut it’s never the sameI guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escapeNow the day bleeds, into nightfall and you’re not here, to get me through it allI let my guard down and then you pulled the rugI was getting kinda used to being someone you lovedAnd I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimesI fall into your arms I'll be safe in your sound til I come back aroundFor now the day bleeds, into nightfall and you’re not here, to get me through it allI let my guard down and then you pulled the rugI was getting kinda used to being someone you lovedBut now the day bleeds, into nightfall and you’re not here, to get me through it allI let my guard down and then you pulled the rugI was getting kinda used to being someone you lovedI let my guard down and then you pulled the rugI was getting kinda used to being someone you loved"

Young people need to see people that look like them in to give them something to aspire to and show them that they can achieve, that they don't have to be a certain way just because they're black.April 1st 2017, my little brother, Ethan was stabbed seven times in an unprovoked attack and That's Not Ours took on a different direction a much more personal one.

Every one who ever met him in any capacity will always remember the positive impact he had on their lives.' He is the tenth fatality on Everest in the current climbing season that ends this month and the 18th in Nepal's Himalayas in the same period.

The creative minds behind Superbad, Pineapple Express and Sausage Party take on sixth grade hard in the outrageous comedy, Good Boys. After being invited to his first kissing party, 12-year-old Max (Room’s Jacob Tremblay) is panicking because he doesn’t know how to kiss. Eager for some pointers, Max and his best friends Thor (Brady Noon, HBO’s Boardwalk Empire) and Lucas (Keith L. Williams, Fox’s The Last Man On Earth) decide to use Max’s dad’s drone – which Max is forbidden to touch – to spy (they think) on a teenage couple making out next door. But when things go ridiculously wrong, the drone is destroyed. Desperate to replace it before Max’s dad (Will Forte, The Last Man on Earth) gets home, the boys skip school and set off on an odyssey of epically bad decisions involving some accidentally stolen drugs, frat-house paintball, and running from both the cops and terrifying teenage girls (Life of the Party’s Molly Gordon and Ocean’s Eight’s Midori Francis). From Point Grey producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the writers of Superbad, Pineapple Express and Sausage Party, and James Weaver (Neighbors), Good Boys, from Universal Pictures and Good Universe, is written by the team of Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky (NBC’s The Office, Bad Teacher).

The moon hangs large and low in the sky, the hours of daylight are becoming unpredictable and animals are beginning to exhibit unusual behaviors. No one quite knows why. News reports are scary and scientists are concerned. But no one foresees the strangest and most dangerous repercussion that will soon start plaguing Centerville:  THE DEAD DON’T DIE -- they rise from their graves and savagely attack and feast on the living -- and the citizens of the town must battle for their survival.  The greatest zombie cast ever disassembled starring Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton, Chloë Sevigny, Steve Buscemi, Danny Glover, Caleb Landry Jones, Rosie Perez, Iggy Pop, Sara Driver, RZA, Selena Gomez, Carol Kane and Tom Waits.  Written and directed by Jim Jarmusch.The independent filmmaker's newest foray into genre film (after the western with Dead Man, Samurai/crime film with Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, and his vampire film, Only Lovers Left Alive) promises to be the greatest cast ever disassembled: Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton, Chloë Sevigny, Steve Buscemi, Danny Glover, Caleb Landry Jones, Rosie Perez, Iggy Pop, Selena Gomez, RZA, Sara Driver, Austin Butler, Luka Sabbat, Eszter Balint, Carol Kane and Tom Waits.  The Dead Don’t Die also reunites Jarmusch with many of his frequent collaborators including Director of Photography Frederick Elmes (Night on Earth, Paterson, Broken Flowers) and Editor Affonso Gonçalves (Only Lovers Left Alive, Paterson).  The Dead Don’t Die is Jim Jarmusch's thirteenth feature film and stands as not just a humorous and sometimes scary subversion of the genre (with a nod to George Romero’s seminal film, Night of the Living Dead) but also a tribute to cinema itself."

Today is another squishy makeover, obviously. I took on a couple really unique ones today. Actually kinda scary....and creepy. Plus one super basic one LOL. Which makeover do you like best?Also. The Koala issue that I mentioned about my LAST makeover video (this is serious). I really don't think that squishy was a koala. Koalas have rounded ears (the squishy had long floppy ears aka a BUNNY COSTUME) and vertical noses (that squishy had a very horizontal nose: BEAR). It also had a very pronounced rim around the face (You can see it in the version I showed today, since it's a COSTUME!) Anddd it was otherwise just plain so i have no idea why most people said it was a koala. But, LET THE DEBATE BEGIN! hahahahaWelcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!I always try to give painting tips and advice, while trying to make i fun.WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...BAKING VIDEOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQIQMIZWG-Y&list=PL807ptvhwHpciWBzyd5NsZcWMRbwBGSFbVIDEO FACTS:–The ballet video of me I showed was from 2012. I was in 11th grade. I love how they edited the recording to zoom out when I fell. Trying to take attention away from the fact I literally fell on my butt haha________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. 8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit. I spend multiple weeks working on them (in combination with my other videos) so it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my art and craft videos as well ☺___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Today is episode #5 of Create This Book 2! I’m breaking out my trusty prismacolor pencils of course, but also trying some new materials today. I bought a set of metallic deco art acrylic paints and I wanted to test them out. It may or may not have been an absolute fail….you’ll have to wait and see.I basically did 4 pages in the episode….kind of. It’s been about a month since I did the last episode. Not too bad. I think once a month is a pretty sustainable frequency for posting this series. Although, at this rate I think I would finish the book in a little over a year from now.

Today, I'm gonna bring you guys along with me to paint over my old, boring cloth organizers. They're pretty plain and white and since I'm going for a very colorful look in my new art room, I thought I could give them a little makeover.I'm in the process of decorating my whole art room, so if you like this video, I may do more like this.These are the typical Ikea cube shelves that everyone and their mother has. I felt like this was something good to share with everyone because I've never seen anyone else do this, and I think it is a pretty easy way to put a personal touch on a room.Obviously you wouldn't have to do this as obnoxiously as me lol. You could be more subdued and classy with it. Or use stencils and whatnot if you don't want to free-hand it.TIPS:Fabric paint works really great on these, but if you can’t find fabric paint, make sure you at least use a paint that is flexible so that it doesn’t crack when you're dragging these in and out of the shelves. Probably not best to use something like acrylic paint. Unless you combine it with a fabric medium.WHAT YOU NEED:1. Cube Shelf  (I’m using the Kallax Shelf from Ikea)2. Cloth box insert (or you can use wooden bins)3. Fabric Paint (switch with acrylic paint if using wooden bins)Im thinking about how to decorate the remaining 4. Not sure if I should do them in the same theme, a different theme or STORAGE BINS (affiliate link):https://amzn.to/2JfiPh4VIDEO FACTS:–If you notice on my very “MESSY” plan, I was going to do metallic accents….obviously I changed my mind about that. I just decided I didn’t want that look…..–I wanted them to each be unique in the own way, but unify them with color. they all have a light rainbow, a dark rainbow and white accents.–I decided not to paint the sides, back or inside of the boxes (only the front) because1. Those areas aren’t visible unless the bin is open and 2. I didn’t want the paint on the outside to stick to the shelf___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYSthis channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYsWhen Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have four children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly, Alessia Saccone Joly and Andrea Saccone Joly they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.Using an Affiliate link means that we receive a percentage of the revenue made from purchasing products through this link.
