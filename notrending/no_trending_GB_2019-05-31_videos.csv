The focus of this video is silica aerogels, though graphene aerogels are now technically the lightest.At one point Dr. Steven Jones literally held the Guinness World Record for making the lightest aerogel and therefore lightest solid. If you're interested in learning more about aerogels, let me know in the comments as there is a potential trilogy in the works...Huge thanks to Dr. Stephen Steiner and the crew at Aerogel Technologies.

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.Flipchart artwork by Maria RaykovaFilmed by Raquel NunoThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci"

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com Colorful Animation 4 SeaweedAnd from Kevin MacLeod Marty Gots a PlanThis is an educational video about the science of water quality."

It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.Filming by Raquel Nuno"

In fact, keen boot spotters will have already clocked these on pitch during those epic Champions League semi final battles. GET YOUR PAIR OF EUPHORIA MODE BOOTS NOW AT PRO:DIRECT SOCCER!http://bit.ly/2VNTtOBThere is a full complement of models on offer, covering all of Nike’s current line up and it’s not just the top of the range Elite versions that are vying for your attention. The Euphoria Mode is good whatever your level, which means you can get the look for less with Academy editions.The over-arching feature of the Euphoria Mode look is the spray, splatter effect design.Immediately you’ll notice the colourway split between the models – something Nike continue to experiment on their recent packs. A white base gets a racer blue colour pop for the Phantom Venom and Vision, whilst the Mercurial and Tiempo switch this up for a dose of Hyper Crimson. We’ve seen similar half-and-half designs before from Nike, but what do you think of this look?

Please see my comments below with regards to reports the video was partially faked.  Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video (I posted this on all my social channels immediately after it happened)- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the “thieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn’t clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I’m really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that, I know my credibility is damaged but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I’ve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of “prank and like I mentioned in the video, it’s pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I’m especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn’t just taint the entire effort as “fake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I’ve built on my channel) and we’ve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I’m sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won’t happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

They rent high speed cameras at killer prices.  Hit them up.ELI20 version:  I answered why you want a large outlet area but not necessarily why it curves like that.  Anytime you have a sudden change in cross-sectional area in the horn you will get waves reflecting back at the source.  You don't want that because that is wasted energy that could have moved forward.  Even if it goes from a small cross-section to a larger, if you do it suddenly you get those wasted waves.  So you want the horn to basically be asymptotic at the exit so you never have a jump in discontinuity when it exits to the wide open air.  So a directors cone isn't as good as the curved shapes I showed because it still has the sudden change when it dumps into the open air.MUSIC-0:10- Arrow- Andrew Applepie - http://andrewapplepie.com/1:08- Dance- Danijel Zambo- https://danijel-zambo.bandcamp.com/2:00- Kalimba Jam- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/3:00- New shoes- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/7:30- Ceral Killa- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/8:47- Q- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/9:46 Too Happy to be cool by Notebreak- https://soundcloud.com/notebreak/dubstep-too-happy-to-be-coolSummary:  I made a huge horn and broke glass with it and explored why horns are shaped the way they are.MERCH-They are soft- https://teespring.com/stores/markroberPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub****************************************­I make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTubeFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTubeTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRoberINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/"

Becoming an organ donor is the first heroic step to creating this legacy – the gift of life. Live Life Give Life is committed to celebrating organ donation and inspiring the individual to leave a positive legacy that lasts for generations. Our goal is to motivate everyone in the UK to register as an organ donor. We want people from all walks of life to sign-up to the NHS Organ Donor Register, and to speak-up and share the decision they’ve made.Live Life Give Life. Make it your legacy.https://www.livelifegivelife.org.uk Jim Lynskey works closely with the donor awareness site Save9Lives to raise people’s awareness and understanding of organ donation. “I’ve been aiming to raise awareness for organ donation with Save9Lives (https://www.save9lives.com/) which works in partnership with The NHS. I formed the campaign when I was transplant listed back in 2015 - it was the fact that one organ donor can potentially save 9 people which really stuck with me amongst the sobering statistics of current donor shortages in the UK. I’ve been unable to access a new heart so far, so I’m now being kept alive with an electric heart pump. I thought I would drive the frustrated energy associated with my experiences into this vibrant Save9Lives campaign message, and I’ve since received some very humbling support from many within the music industry. As a fan, it’s a huge honour to work with Lewis alongside his incredible Someone You Loved video. Register as an organ donor at Save9Lives (https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/register-to-donate/?campaign=2462) will allow us to track how many people have been inspired by Lewis’ powerful message illustrated in his video release. I’m sure I speak on behalf of the 6000+ patents awaiting a transplant today in saying thank you for raising such vital awareness, in celebration of Someone You Loved”——————————————————Lyrics I’m going under and this time I fear there’s no one to save meThis all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazyI need somebody to healsomebody to knowsomebody to havesomebody to holdIt’s easy to saybut it’s never the sameI guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the painNow the day bleeds, into nightfalland you’re not here, to get me through it allI let my guard down and then you pulled the rugI was getting kinda used to being someone you lovedI’m going under and this time I fear there’s no one to turn toThis all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without youNow I need somebody to know somebody to heal somebody to have just to know how it feelsIt’s easy to saybut it’s never the sameI guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escapeNow the day bleeds, into nightfall and you’re not here, to get me through it allI let my guard down and then you pulled the rugI was getting kinda used to being someone you lovedAnd I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimesI fall into your arms I'll be safe in your sound til I come back aroundFor now the day bleeds, into nightfall and you’re not here, to get me through it allI let my guard down and then you pulled the rugI was getting kinda used to being someone you lovedBut now the day bleeds, into nightfall and you’re not here, to get me through it allI let my guard down and then you pulled the rugI was getting kinda used to being someone you lovedI let my guard down and then you pulled the rugI was getting kinda used to being someone you loved"

I'm a Sagittarius so... this is clearly the superior video. ;) If you missed the first one, you can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQBh6Y3R1lI&t=964sOk forgive the copy-paste Description x) These were based off of multiple articles and resources I read about each Zodiac sign, then interpreted by me to make a trigger that I think each sign would like! Since there are 12 of them, I had to film it over two days. This is part 2!I did this based off of Sun Signs but if you're into astrology, you know that we have other things that make up our personalities as well! And if you're not into astrology... just sit back and relax :D I always found it fun/interesting (as I do with any personality assessment) but yeah!Timestamps & Explanations! 0:00 - Intro1:46 - Libra / Positive Affirmations(September 23 - October 22)Charming, balanced, and placing a heavy importance on relationships, Libras love to keep the peace but sometimes struggle with putting themselves first. I wanted to give some clear, positive affirmations to relax, calm, and assure what Libras already know: that the key to life is a fine balance!6:40 - Scorpio / Mic Touching(October 23 - November 21)Incredibly powerful and incredibly passionate Scorpio!! I knew my most intense ASMR trigger would have to be for you! Scorpios know what they want and they aren't afraid to go get it! Not everyone loves the intense Mic Touching sound, but I figured if anyone would, it's the Scorpio that craves physical closeness and intensity!11:25 - Sagittarius / Hand Movements(November 22 - December 21)CLEARLY the best!!! 1! !! ! ! ! The Sagittarius love to tell stories, are theatrical, and most of the time, the class clown. I thought hand movements would be perfect because of its visual draw, as Sagittarius can be constantly moving and unfocused, and need something to look at to anchor their minds.  16:28 - Capricorn / Planning & Paper Sounds(December 22 - January 19)Incredibly strong, Capricorn folks can overcome absolutely anything that gets in between them and their goals! Their focus can sometimes be a bit calculated, and borderline workaholic. I thought Capricorns would appreciate a bit of indulgent planning and writing sounds! But don't let it make you start thinking about the things you need to do -- just relax for now :) 20:48 - Aquarius / Flashlight Triggers(January 20 - February 18) The Aquarius is free-spirited, nonconformist, and dedicated to making their world a better place. I wanted to do a light trigger for the Aquarius to represent their spirit, which is free, natural, and of course, bright! Because the Aquarius can sometimes be distant in relationships, I hope that the light will warm you up a little bit too :')26:11 - Pisces / Candle Sounds(February 19 - March 20)Constantly battling divided attention, the Pisces is a culmination of all of the other signs, as its the last in the Zodiac. Pisces are the MOST empathetic, compassionate, and sensitive. I wanted to ground the Pisces with a very physical/real-world trigger, lighting candles, but also play on the magical feeling of looking at flames.  🎵I’m now on Spotify!

I probably (definitely) am not the best channel to do this since I know uh... not too much in depth about astrology but I would love to see a more educated channel do this so, if you see it, give it a whirl and link me! :D These were based off of multiple articles and resources I read about each Zodiac sign, then interpreted by me to make a trigger that I think each sign would like!

And if you're not into astrology... just sit back and relax :D I always found it fun/interesting (as I do with any personality assessment) but yeah!Timestamps & Explanations! 0:00 - Intro1:47 - Aries / Hair Brush Sounds(March 21-April 19) Aries lead with the head! Uncomplicated, confident, and appreciating individual attention, I figured the classic Hair Brushing Trigger would be best for some head-attention! :D6:32 - Taurus / Wood Triggers(April 20-May 20)Taurus is an earth sign! They enjoy relaxing environment and soft sounds, but can be on the stubborn side! I wanted to do the soft yet natural sound of wood tapping, a solid and reliable material!10:58 - Gemini / Roleplay(Happy Birthday y'all!) (May 21 - June 20)The social butterflies! I wanted to do a light roleplay to represent another person for the Gemini twins! Gemini are creative, progressive, and perhaps a bit hyperactive! So I tried to reflect that in the roleplay :)16:00 - Cancer / Touching & Brushing(June 21 - July 22)Highly intuitive and sensitive, I thought that Face touching and brushing would be perfect! It's a really light sounding trigger but very personal. Cancers may appear as standoffish at first, but they're gentle and compassionate inside! 20:51 - Leo / Makeup(July 23 - August 22)The Leo!! Confident! Theatrical! Attention-loving! Let's do some makeup on you! It's personal attention AND making you look quite dashing. And, if the thought of getting your makeup done is kind of scary -- Leos are known for their bravery and deep wells of courage to try something new!25:32 - Virgo / Face Cleaning(August 23 - September 22)The lovely Virgo follows perfectly from the Leo/makeup trigger, because they are logical, practical, and detail oriented! Perfect for taking OFF the makeup we just put on, and making sure each crevice and surface is clean and neat ^_^. They are meticulous, kind, and supportive. I hope you enjoyed! Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces will be showcased on Thursday! :D🎵I’m now on Spotify!

It was a day of unique fruits, most specifically the pequi fruit, unlike any other natural unprocessed food I’ve ever tried in my life. #BrazilianFood #Goiás #fruitMercado Central de Goiânia - We began at the central market, where we walked around first, before trying a number of empadão, one of the main snacks to eat - a little dough pie filled with a variety of ingredients. It was delicious and hearty, especially when topped with some of the house made hot sauce. Price - 32 BRL ($7.93) for allExotic fruit - There was a jungle exotic Brazilian fruit shop where we sampled a few fruits like jatoba, before continued on this Brazilian food tour.CIDADE DE GOIÁS - The main goal of the day was to drive to the historical city of Goiás, about 2 hours from Goiânia. The drive was beautiful and it was nice to see some of the countryside.Restaurante Braseiro - But by far the highlight of the day was eating at Restaurante Braseiro, an extremely friendly and traditional Brazilian food restaurant. When we arrived I could already sense the love coming from the restaurant, and I loved the way they cooked the food, all over fire in the kitchen buffet style. The day we arrived they hadn’t cooked pequi fruit, but when we arrived and said was had come specifically to eat it, they cooked it for us. Pequi is a very unique and slightly bizarre fruit from this region of Brazil. It can be dangerous because of the spikes in the center - so don’t bite too deep. But the flavor is unlike any other fruit I’ve ever had, almost like cheddar cheese. Price - 20 BRL ($4.95) per personBanca da Pamonha - When we got back to the city, we continued with a few Brazilian street food snacks, including pamonha, which is the local version of a tamale. I was impressed how good they were. Price - 26 BRL ($6.44) for 3Boteco do Zé do Abílio - Finally to end this Brazilian food tour, we went to Boteco do Zé do Abílio to have some serious meat. Total price - 118 BRL ($29.23)It was an amazing day in Brazil, and especially a regional Brazilian food learning experience.Thanks to Guilherme and Rafa from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

It’s a pleasant city, and they known especially for meat. In this video we go on a Brazilian food tour of Curitiba, explore some of the iconic meat dishes of the city, and eat a 5 kilo family sandwich! #Brazil #BrazilianFood #hugefoodMercearia Fantinato - Carne de onça (Jaguar meat), known as jaguar meat, yet of course not jaguar at all, this steak tartare (raw minced beef) got its name because of the raw meat breath you’ll have after you eat it. It’s mixed table-side, and it’s delicious.Price - 53.99 BRL ($13.54)Costelão do Gaúcho - One of the things that Curitiba is known for, and all of southern Brazil, is meat - and especially the beef ribs are among the prized cut. Costelão do Gaúcho is an amazing restaurant that specializes in beef ribs. The owner is a master, treating each rack of ribs with respect and roasting and smoking them with precision. I loved his table saw method of cutting the ribs. The ribs were outstanding, as was the entire meal with all the side salads and dishes.4 Beans Coffee Co. - We stopped in for a quick coffee, but that turned into a coffee roasting session, which was fantastic.Lanchonete da Lombada - Here we go, the mega 5 kg. Lombada sandwich. Lombada means speedbump in Portuguese, because it was formerly a street food stall right in front of the speedbump. It was just insane, huge bun, layers of meat, hot dogs, massive quantities of squeeze cheese. It’s not a food challenge, but a very popular local family meal in Curitiba, Brazil. Total price - 50 BRL ($12.45)Tio Dog (Uncle Dog) - Probably one of the most iconic of all the Brazilian fast food in Curitiba is TIo Dog, specialising in a number of different sandwiches and hot dogs. We got The Philadelphia, a bun filled with hot dogs, a variety of unknown sauces, and little crunchy chip fries. It’s one of those late night impulse foods - not something I’d eat on a daily basis.Curitiba was fun, and it was a Brazilian food tour of meat!Thanks to Guilherme and Rafa from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

Today we went on a short hike to the famous Telegraph rock, and then ate an incredible Brazilian seafood meal. #Brazil #RiodeJaneiro #foodOysters - It was about an hour drive from the center of Rio, and we arrived to the oyster man - a little stall where a man has been selling oysters since Guilherme was a child. His oysters were small, but they were flavorful, with just a squeeze of lime. Perfect way to begin this Brazilian food day. Price - 12 for 10 BRL ($2.50)Pedra Do Telégrafo - We then drove to a small beach town and climbed up the hill to a point known as Pedra Do Telégrafo, or Telegraph rock. It’s most famou now because of social media, and people take a photo in a way that it looks like they are dangling from a rock cliff. The views are spectacular and well worth climbing when you’re in Rio.Gugut Restaurante - Located in Vargem Grande neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, we met up with Marcelo to eat a massive Brazilian seafood meal, especially dishes from the Espirito Santo state of Brazil.Moqueca - There are two versions of this amazing dish, a fish stew, one from Espirito Santo and the other from Bahia (stay tuned for Bahia coming soon). He added in tomatoes, onions, and cilantro, followed by fish. It was simple but delicious, relying on the fresh fish to really made it special. Gugut Restaurant is not cheap, but they serve top notch seafood, great quality, and very fresh. All the food was delicious. Total price - 400 BRL ($100.32)And that completes this Brazilian seafood and hike in Rio de Janeiro, another wonderful day in Brazil.Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

But to be honest I had never been to any outside of Brazil - and there was no better place to have my first Brazilian meat churrascaria experience than in Brazil.Churrascaria Palace (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/xtKKEisbcvWv9P8m6) - We chose to go to Churrascaria Palace, a meat restaurant located in Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro. As soon as I stepped into the restaurant, I could smell the aroma of the roasting meats, and it was a great upscale, yet laid back atmosphere, with live music.Chef Silva took care of us from the moment we stepped in and first showed us the kitchen where the meats were being roasted. It’s very interesting to learn about the different cuts of meat that they use in Brazil, which are unique to Brazil. One of the unique and beloved types of meat is cupim, which comes from the beef hump from Zebu cattle.Once Chef Silva started bringing us meats, he did not joke around - the Brazilian steakhouse bbq meats started flowing non stop. A Brazilian steakhouse bbq is typically served Rodízio, meaning it’s all you can eat, but the meat is not served buffet style, but rather it’s served to you at your plate. They slice it in front of you, and then you use your tongs to grab the meat as its sliced in front of you.Chef Silva served us 14 types of meat, including some Amazon river fish.

There are estimates of as many as 1,000 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many of the favelas in Rio de Janeiro are full cities within themselves, where nearly everything is available.It’s without a doubt that a lot of crime and organized underground criminal activity happens and is controlled in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. However, favelas across Brazil are home to some of the most hard working, friendly, happy, and creative people in Brazil as well. So in this video my goal was to meet and to highlight some of the amazing people that call favelas home. Rocinha - The first favela we visited was Rocinha, the biggest favela in Rio, one of the biggest in Brazil. We met up with Guilherme who took us on a walking tour to some viewpoints and to some Brazilian food places.Sabor da Roça - The most well known little snack shop on this street in Rocinha, we stopped for a coxinha, one of the top Brazilian food snacks. It was packed with chicken and with some hot sauce it was amazing. Price -  2.5 BRL ($0.63)For lunch we stopped at an alleyway restaurant in Rocinha, where he cooked up a lunch set included beef ribs, cassava, pasta, rice, and beans. It was simple, but delicious and hearty.Price - 10 BRL ($2.52)Morro da Providência - Favela number two is one of the first favelas of Rio and located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, near the port and up on a hill on the side of the cliff. We met up with Jura, who is an absolute Brazilian food cooking legend and an amazing person.One of Jura’s most famous dishes is nhoque de camarão, an Italian but Brazilian potato noodles in Jura’s own creation sauce of shrimp and coconut milk. It was simply outstanding, all made from scratch.But the dish I was most interested in eating and which Jura expertly cooked, again from scratch was her feijoada - often considered the national dish of Brazil, and one of my personal favorite foods of Brazil as well - there are few dishes of the world more comforting than beans and pig parts with rice. When you’re in Brazil, you can eat feijoada at many restaurants, but home-cooked is by far the best.Thank you Jura and Elena!!This was one of the best days I had in Brazil in terms of learning, meeting people, and food, and it’s an experience and memories I’ll never forget. You hear a lot of the negative that comes out of favelas in Brazil, and it is true. However, the positive side and the amazing people, are not often recognized, and it was truly memorable to see and learn about this side of hope in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

No, not just the idea that the characters I love were going to perish but the fact that, if you watch all the movies very closely, you notice that the toys are pretty much immortal. Look at Sid's toys: They were mangled and manipulated to the point where you could barely see what they originally were, yet they were STILL ALIVE!

And fill me in?Did you think you could do it again? I’m not your sinI was all that you wanted and more- but you didn’t want meI was more than you thought I could beSo I’m setting you free- I’m setting you free You’ve Killed The Saint In MeHow Dare You Martyr MeYou’ve Killed The Saint In Me Oh, I’ll never kill myself to save my soul/I was gone but how was I to know?I didn’t come this far to sink so low/I’m finally holding on to letting go You’ve Killed The Saint In Me/How Dare You Martyr MeYou’ve Killed The Saint In Me/How Dare You Martyr Me"

Today I'm going to be unboxing a toooon of squishy packages. It's been about 2 months since I did this, so I was reallly excited to open some packages! You guys are so awesome for participating in this. I seriously have such a blast every time.*IMPORTANT*As some of you may know, I only send out my new P.O. box address to a few people at a time (any uncovered addresses in this video or past videos is my old address and no longer mine). I've asked you guys to email me directly (fanmail@moriah.video) to request my new address. IF you have done that and not received a response, I'm sorry! I have about 6,000 unread emails in that folder, it's impossible for me to keep up. I definitely can't send my address out to all 6,000 people because then I would have more packages than I know what to do with. I don't want anyone spending their time/effort/money on sending me a package and then never get the chance to be on camera because I have too many other packages to deal with. That's why I only respond to about 5-10 people each week. So it's actually very rare that I do respond. It's very random also. Feel free to try as many times as you would like, and please don't be offended if you don't hear back. ______FOR THE NEW COMERS (if there are any)________A couple of months ago, I started this series called “Squishy Makeovers.” I was using ugly, cheap squishies and then painting them, adding to them and fixing them up however I saw fit. That series became a new favorite on my channel, and I decided to allow subscribers to participate by donating their own ugly, used, broken or unwanted squishies. At the time, I had a much smaller audience, but quickly my channel grew and I became overwhelmed with tons of squishy packages.  I am still working on catching up with all the packages I have received in the last few months. I have spent 4 entire videos unboxing squishy donations, and this is the biggest batch so far. Everyone comments on these videos, which squishies they want to see in the makeover videos (3 candidates), and I give the most popular requests a makeover in the next makeover video (every other Friday). These packages are donation only, from people who no longer want the squishies or are just interested in seeing them on camera. The squishies are not returned to the sender after the makeovers. If that doesn’t make sense, I made a video to explain. I’d appreciate if you checked it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKYCVbM8RU4___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Today is another squishy makeover, obviously. I took on a couple really unique ones today. Actually kinda scary....and creepy. Plus one super basic one LOL. Which makeover do you like best?Also. The Koala issue that I mentioned about my LAST makeover video (this is serious). I really don't think that squishy was a koala. Koalas have rounded ears (the squishy had long floppy ears aka a BUNNY COSTUME) and vertical noses (that squishy had a very horizontal nose: BEAR). It also had a very pronounced rim around the face (You can see it in the version I showed today, since it's a COSTUME!) Anddd it was otherwise just plain so i have no idea why most people said it was a koala. But, LET THE DEBATE BEGIN! hahahahaWelcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!I always try to give painting tips and advice, while trying to make i fun.WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...BAKING VIDEOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQIQMIZWG-Y&list=PL807ptvhwHpciWBzyd5NsZcWMRbwBGSFbVIDEO FACTS:–The ballet video of me I showed was from 2012. I was in 11th grade. I love how they edited the recording to zoom out when I fell. Trying to take attention away from the fact I literally fell on my butt haha________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. 8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit. I spend multiple weeks working on them (in combination with my other videos) so it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my art and craft videos as well ☺___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Today, I'm gonna bring you guys along with me to paint over my old, boring cloth organizers. They're pretty plain and white and since I'm going for a very colorful look in my new art room, I thought I could give them a little makeover.I'm in the process of decorating my whole art room, so if you like this video, I may do more like this.These are the typical Ikea cube shelves that everyone and their mother has. I felt like this was something good to share with everyone because I've never seen anyone else do this, and I think it is a pretty easy way to put a personal touch on a room.Obviously you wouldn't have to do this as obnoxiously as me lol. You could be more subdued and classy with it. Or use stencils and whatnot if you don't want to free-hand it.TIPS:Fabric paint works really great on these, but if you can’t find fabric paint, make sure you at least use a paint that is flexible so that it doesn’t crack when you're dragging these in and out of the shelves. Probably not best to use something like acrylic paint. Unless you combine it with a fabric medium.WHAT YOU NEED:1. Cube Shelf  (I’m using the Kallax Shelf from Ikea)2. Cloth box insert (or you can use wooden bins)3. Fabric Paint (switch with acrylic paint if using wooden bins)Im thinking about how to decorate the remaining 4. Not sure if I should do them in the same theme, a different theme or STORAGE BINS (affiliate link):https://amzn.to/2JfiPh4VIDEO FACTS:–If you notice on my very “MESSY” plan, I was going to do metallic accents….obviously I changed my mind about that. I just decided I didn’t want that look…..–I wanted them to each be unique in the own way, but unify them with color. they all have a light rainbow, a dark rainbow and white accents.–I decided not to paint the sides, back or inside of the boxes (only the front) because1. Those areas aren’t visible unless the bin is open and 2. I didn’t want the paint on the outside to stick to the shelf___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Director Jon Favreau’s all-new “The Lion King” journeys to the African savanna where a future king is born. Simba idolizes his father, King Mufasa, and takes to heart his own royal destiny. But not everyone in the kingdom celebrates the new cub’s arrival. Scar, Mufasa’s brother—and former heir to the throne—has plans of his own. The battle for Pride Rock is ravaged with betrayal, tragedy and drama, ultimately resulting in Simba’s exile. With help from a curious pair of newfound friends, Simba will have to figure out how to grow up and take back what is rightfully his. The all-star cast includes Donald Glover as Simba, Beyoncé Knowles-Carter as Nala, James Earl Jones as Mufasa, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, Seth Rogen as Pumbaa and Billy Eichner as Timon. Utilizing pioneering filmmaking techniques to bring treasured characters to life in a whole new way, Disney’s “The Lion King” roars into theaters on July 19, 2019.

It began life as a response to the constant negative stereotypes of black men and boys in the mainstream media; Channel 5's Gangland being the straw that broke the camel's back.It seemed that the media had no interest in telling other narratives about black people.  Young people need to see people that look like them in to give them something to aspire to and show them that they can achieve, that they don't have to be a certain way just because they're black.April 1st 2017, my little brother, Ethan was stabbed seven times in an unprovoked attack and That's Not Ours took on a different direction a much more personal one.

The creative minds behind Superbad, Pineapple Express and Sausage Party take on sixth grade hard in the outrageous comedy, Good Boys. After being invited to his first kissing party, 12-year-old Max (Room’s Jacob Tremblay) is panicking because he doesn’t know how to kiss. Eager for some pointers, Max and his best friends Thor (Brady Noon, HBO’s Boardwalk Empire) and Lucas (Keith L. Williams, Fox’s The Last Man On Earth) decide to use Max’s dad’s drone – which Max is forbidden to touch – to spy (they think) on a teenage couple making out next door. But when things go ridiculously wrong, the drone is destroyed. Desperate to replace it before Max’s dad (Will Forte, The Last Man on Earth) gets home, the boys skip school and set off on an odyssey of epically bad decisions involving some accidentally stolen drugs, frat-house paintball, and running from both the cops and terrifying teenage girls (Life of the Party’s Molly Gordon and Ocean’s Eight’s Midori Francis). From Point Grey producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the writers of Superbad, Pineapple Express and Sausage Party, and James Weaver (Neighbors), Good Boys, from Universal Pictures and Good Universe, is written by the team of Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky (NBC’s The Office, Bad Teacher).

The greatest zombie cast ever disassembled starring Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton, Chloë Sevigny, Steve Buscemi, Danny Glover, Caleb Landry Jones, Rosie Perez, Iggy Pop, Sara Driver, RZA, Selena Gomez, Carol Kane and Tom Waits.  Written and directed by Jim Jarmusch.The independent filmmaker's newest foray into genre film (after the western with Dead Man, Samurai/crime film with Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, and his vampire film, Only Lovers Left Alive) promises to be the greatest cast ever disassembled: Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton, Chloë Sevigny, Steve Buscemi, Danny Glover, Caleb Landry Jones, Rosie Perez, Iggy Pop, Selena Gomez, RZA, Sara Driver, Austin Butler, Luka Sabbat, Eszter Balint, Carol Kane and Tom Waits.  The Dead Don’t Die also reunites Jarmusch with many of his frequent collaborators including Director of Photography Frederick Elmes (Night on Earth, Paterson, Broken Flowers) and Editor Affonso Gonçalves (Only Lovers Left Alive, Paterson).  The Dead Don’t Die is Jim Jarmusch's thirteenth feature film and stands as not just a humorous and sometimes scary subversion of the genre (with a nod to George Romero’s seminal film, Night of the Living Dead) but also a tribute to cinema itself."

Produced in collaboration with YouTube Music, this installment of Artist Spotlight Stories acts as the final chapter of our journey inside Billie's head, and unveils the deeply personal, unexpected and infinitely visual creative process of this generation-defining artist. Whether she’s watching music videos with the sound off, drawing camera angles in her sketchbook, or ascribing a color, shape and texture to each of her songs, Billie breaks down her unique visual language and gives us a glimpse into the inner workings of her mind."
