I know you’ll be looking down.Swear I’m gonna make you proud.I’ll be living one life for the two of us.I can feel your blood run through me.You’re written in my DNA, Looking back in every mirror.I know you’ll be waiting.I’ll see you again.But you once told me ‘don’t give up..You can do it day by day..And diamonds they don't turn to dust or fade away’ (fade away)So I will keep you, day and night.Here until the day I die,I’ll be living one life for the two of us.I will be the best of me,Always keep you next to me.I’ll be living one life for the two of us.Even when I’m on my own, I know I won’t be alone.Tattoo’d on my heart are the words of your favourite song.

I know you’ll be looking down.Swear I’m gonna make you proud.I’ll be living one life for the two of us."

So naturally, he went off to New Jersey to experience the services of a salon that’s tanned iconic celebrities including the cast members of “The Jersey Shore” and “The Real Housewives.” Unfortunately, Sizzle Tans has received a heap of one star reviews from people claiming to have experienced bad customer service — and subpar tanning results. At the risk of getting burned, Taji went to get a spray tan from one of Yelp’s worst-rated tanning salons to see if the reviews are accurate, or if they could redeem themselves.Watch more episodes of One Star Reviews with Taji: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqZBC60vuhM&list=PLDbSvEZka6GHgTPhrChu9GGP21k802Y7h&index=2&t=0sClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICEAbout VICE:The Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

We know that the Children of the Forest created them from human men, and that they needed healthy human babies to continue their line. We know that they took these babies to a place in their home in the Lands of Always Winter, which looked an awful lot like a civilized settlement. We heard them emit what sounded like screeches, but to them seemed to be a sort of language.Had they succeeded in tightening their frigid grip upon the world, they might have had plans beyond mayhem and death.

But for one person in particular, being able to discuss the ending of Game of Thrones is a massive relief. Isaac Hempstead Wright has revealed that he’s been waiting for months to crow to the world that his character Bran Stark shockingly ended up as ruler of Westeros. As he enthusiastically put it to Entertainment Weekly, quote, I just want to shout: 'King motherf---ers!'Of course, Game of Thrones is a series famous for its twists, having shocked fans before with scenes like the Red Wedding, the gruesome battle between Prince Oberyn Martell and the Mountain, Jon Snow's impermanent death, the haunting sacrifice of Shireen Baratheon by her own parents, and many more. But that didn't prepare Hempstead Wright for the reality of Bran becoming King. In fact, when he first read the script for the finale, he thought the scene where the gathered nobles of Westeros elect Bran king was actually an elaborate prank.When I got to the [Dragonpit scene] in the last episode and they're like, 'What about Bran?' I had to get up and pace around the room. I genuinely thought it was a joke script.” According to the actor, his first thought upon reading the script was that showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss had sent each cast member a script with their own character ending up on the Iron Throne. Once he realized that Game of Thrones really would end with The North becoming its own independent kingdom and the so-called Bran the Broken rising as the ruler of the remaining Six Kingdoms, Hempstead Wright got to thinking about whether it all made sense - and from the actor's perspective, he feels Bran is a fantastic fit for the job.Bran may not be strictly human anymore, given his otherworldly status as the unemotional Three-Eyed Raven. But his psychic omniscience and separation from the petty squabbles of his fellow man is also beneficial, letting him potentially keep Westeros safe like no one else can. He's all logic and reason, without the dangerous emotions that led to the disastrous reigns of previous terrible monarchs like King Robert, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei, and Queen Daenerys. Hempstead Wright said,I think he'll be a really good king actually. Perhaps there will be something missing in having a real emotive leader, which is a useful quality in a king or queen as well. At the same time, you can't really argue with Bran. He's like, 'No, I know everything.'The actor assured fans that despite his initial shock, he’s happy with the way the Thrones finale worked out. But he did share his thoughts about an alternate conclusion he might have enjoyed even more. Thinking about other ways the series ending could have gone, Hempstead Wright shared, I kind of did want to die and get in one good death scene with an exploding head or something.It’s a relatable desire, but come on - no one can beat the Viper in that department.Of course, not everyone is happy with Bran becoming king, or the events that led up to it, like Jon killing Daenerys. After the finale aired on May 19, fans flocked to social media to vent their outrage and frustration - which is, after all, the primary use of social media.  Even Thrones actors themselves have expressed frustration with how the series ended, though most of those gripes centered more on each star's respective character arcs and less on the larger picture.  When all is said and done, though, Hempstead Wright is confident that the ending of Game of Thrones - as shocking and polarizing as it is - is exactly how A Song of Ice and Fire author George R.R. Martin would have drawn the story to a close if he had gotten there first. Speaking before the finale aired, the actor shared a prediction about the fan reaction that turned out to be correct, saying,Not everyone will be happy. [...] I don't think anybody will think it's predictable and that's as much as you can hope for. People are going to be angry. There's going to be a lot of broken hearts. It's 'bittersweet,' exactly as George R. R. Martin intended. It's a fitting conclusion to this epic saga.#GameOfThrones #GoT #BranStark"

It's something that Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have learned the hard way, as the final season of the pop culture phenomenon has infuriated and disappointed legions of fans and critics around the world. In fact, so many people were upset by the final season that over a million viewers signed an online petition calling for HBO to remake all six episodes with different storylines and a new team of writers. So what does the cast of Game of Thrones think about all this? Well, Isaac Hempstead Wright, who plays the newest king of Westeros, Bran Stark, told The Hollywood Reporter that he for one thought the petition was absurd. I saw today there's a petition to redo the ending […] It's just absurd. I can't even fathom it. [...] It's ridiculous that people think they can just demand a different ending because they don't like it.Hempstead Wright admitted that he took the petition personally, in part because he just doesn't agree with people who think the final season was bad. What people were hoping for is an Avengers-esque thing where all the superpowers are explained and everybody comes together and there's a big team effort. Game of Thrones isn't like that. It's unpredictable by nature. [...] In my opinion, it's a great ending […] I don't think it's some plot twist to be shocking for the sake of shocking. I think it's a genuine character development.In fact, he thinks people getting angry at the ending is just further proof of how good the show was.The fact that characters are not doing what people want them to do? It's a good thing. The fact that people are getting pissed off and having a big emotional response? That's the reason why Game of Thrones is successful. It doesn't do what everyone wants them to do.Of course, the interview with Hempstead Wright was published before the season finale aired on Sunday, May 19. At the time the petition was created, fans were still infuriated over the events of the show's penultimate episode, The Bells, which saw fan favorite Daenerys Targaryen go completely mental and mass-murder tens if not hundreds of thousands of people for what seemed like no good reason.The finale, though, has by and large received kinder critical and fan reviews. Though it didn't fully satisfy everyone, the death of Daenerys at Jon Snow's hand, and the subsequent crowning of Bran the Three-Eyed Raven as king of the Six Kingdoms was met more with resigned shrugs than blinding rage. And at least Benioff and Weiss wrote and directed the finale themselves, making sure that the final responsibility for bringing the series home rested on the right shoulders. After all, as Ned taught Bran way back in the series premiere,The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.So while it's true that few fans got everything they wanted out of the finale, the fact that nobody's completely satisfied might actually be a good thing. Just ask Tyrion:No one is very happy, which means it's a good compromise I suppose.Indeed, the last episode of Game of Thrones took some interesting turns and placed power into the hands of a few unexpected people. It also gave the members of the Stark family a relatively happy ending, something nobody could have expected after all the losses they suffered in previous seasons.And the divisive final season doesn't change the fact that so many people genuinely love the show, or that Thrones will go down in history as one of the most popular television series of this generation.As the new king of Westeros said,If people really, really hate this season? Then so be it. But it's been seven or eight years of absolutely brilliant television that captivated the world [...] I think people will remember it as a fabulous journey to have been a part of, no matter their opinion on the ending.Watch the video to see how the GoT star slams the fan petition for a Season 8 remake!#GameOfThrones #GOT #GameOfThronesFinale"

What did people have to say about the series' controversial conclusion? Here are some of the more searing reactions.Tragic, ironic, and maybe inevitable, Jon Snow ended his arc not sitting the Iron Throne, but instead as the slayer of both his kin and his queen. Jon's stabbing of Daenerys in the destroyed throne room of the Red Keep is exactly the kind of story turn we've come to expect from Game of Thrones. But the turns it took to get there felt pretty rushed to a lot of people.One poster expressed sympathy for Daenerys as a character, writing,a moment of silence for daenerys targaryen, a victim to horrible writing and a rushed story. may she rest in peaceOthers took the conclusion of her story personally, with more than one poster expressing real frustration. According to one commenter,daenerys deserves SUCH a better death. after all she’s done, good and bad, she’s one of the most iconic characters in television history...and that death did not do her justice AT ALL. I’M MAD.Even people who liked the finale seemed to express some frustration with the speed at which Daenerys' story developed.Initial GameOfThronesFinale thoughts: An excellent finale. I still think Dany's decisions were rushed but the outcome was satisfying and there were strong character moments for just about everyone, especially Tyrion.Some wondered just where Dany's guards were during her final encounter with Jon, who was able to easily stab the queen during a private moment, at a time when the loyalty of her advisors was actively being questioned. As one writer put it,why did Tyrion have more guards then Daenerys? Why did they take Jons weapon away when he saw Tyrion but not Dany?One commenter broke it down as follows:That was terrible. Like she'd just wander off to the throne room alone without some Unsullied or Dothraki  guarding her, especially from the likes of Jon Snow, whom she said betrayed her and was the biggest threat to her claim to the throne.Others outright rejected the idea that Daenerys would have gone so mad so fast, still feeling the sting of her sudden heel turn in the previous episode, The Bells.

Even so, audiences have always rooted for Daenerys, cheering her on as she frees slaves, saves innocents, and fights those in power to give it to those below, until the end of season eight.Daenerys' torching of King's Landing during the penultimate episode, The Bells, wasn't entirely unexpected, but her descent into madness was seen as abrupt and unearned, as if viewers were supposed to forget about Daenerys' humanity and believe she would kill thousands of innocent people without a passing thought. For her part, Clarke might have tried to warn audiences about this before the season aired.In 2018, Clarke revealed to Vanity Fair that her final scenes were incredibly upsetting and that fans might look at Daenerys differently, given that her continued passion for war leads to Jon Snow ultimately having to kill her.

According to the dictionary, psychopathy is defined by impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits. The word psychopath does not imply delusional thought or irrational action. Euron thinks extremely highly of himself and is incapable of empathizing with other people. And now he seeks final Ascension. The Horn, Victarion, and Holy Men all seem key to Euron’s Grand Plan.Thanks for watching!Cover Art by: Bella Bergolts: https://bergolts.artstation.com/projects/OV6dwPlease consider supporting this channel on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ideasoficeandfireThe Book I helped write: https://www.amazon.com/Thrones-Effect-HBOs-Conquered-Culture/dp/0998029947/ref=sr_1_1?crid=A2RMTG1N5WWR&keywords=the+thrones+effect&qid=1558142871&s=gateway&sprefix=thrones+eff%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRELike me on Facebook!: https://www.facebook.com/IOIAFFeel free to leave a comment like and subscribe!Thanks For Watching!"

Today, I'm gonna bring you guys along with me to paint over my old, boring cloth organizers. They're pretty plain and white and since I'm going for a very colorful look in my new art room, I thought I could give them a little makeover.I'm in the process of decorating my whole art room, so if you like this video, I may do more like this.These are the typical Ikea cube shelves that everyone and their mother has. I felt like this was something good to share with everyone because I've never seen anyone else do this, and I think it is a pretty easy way to put a personal touch on a room.Obviously you wouldn't have to do this as obnoxiously as me lol. You could be more subdued and classy with it. Or use stencils and whatnot if you don't want to free-hand it.TIPS:Fabric paint works really great on these, but if you can’t find fabric paint, make sure you at least use a paint that is flexible so that it doesn’t crack when you're dragging these in and out of the shelves. Probably not best to use something like acrylic paint. Unless you combine it with a fabric medium.WHAT YOU NEED:1. Cube Shelf  (I’m using the Kallax Shelf from Ikea)2. Cloth box insert (or you can use wooden bins)3. Fabric Paint (switch with acrylic paint if using wooden bins)Im thinking about how to decorate the remaining 4. Not sure if I should do them in the same theme, a different theme or STORAGE BINS (affiliate link):https://amzn.to/2JfiPh4VIDEO FACTS:–If you notice on my very “MESSY” plan, I was going to do metallic accents….obviously I changed my mind about that. I just decided I didn’t want that look…..–I wanted them to each be unique in the own way, but unify them with color. they all have a light rainbow, a dark rainbow and white accents.–I decided not to paint the sides, back or inside of the boxes (only the front) because1. Those areas aren’t visible unless the bin is open and 2.

Today is another squishy makeover, obviously. I took care of the soft n slo cat with the tail, a unicorn (i mean, alicorn ugh) hugging on the moon, and a little surprise resident for my cottage from last episode (as promised). I had some struggles as usual, but I think overall they came out well. Do you like them?!?!?!Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...VIDEO FACTS:–I did the whole showing while editing thing for the first time. I have recently been using clips of my face from old videos to give facial reactions but I got tired of sifting through old footage, so i just quickly filmed those bits on my computer. not sure how i feel about it yet, or if it'll be a thing. i know a lot of other youtubers are doing that now also, so ehhh idk. after reading the comments, some people seemed to like it, some people didnt. we'll see! –Apparently having a male calico cat is super rare. A lot of people are saying it's impossible in the comments, BUT i looked it up and actually its just uncommon. About 1 in 3,000 calico cats are male. So he's jus special then haha :)–based on the comments, the bear in the bunny costume is a koala? I would have never guessed that in a million years. How are those koala ears!?!? And why is there a rim around the face as if its wearing a costume?! I have no clue. but a lot of ya'll are saying it, so I guess it is a koala. sure?? ________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. 8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit. I spend multiple weeks working on them (in combination with my other videos) so it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my art and craft videos as well ☺___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/CONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Both redefining and transcending the genre, “IT” became part of the cultural zeitgeist as well as the highest-grossing horror film of all time.Because every 27 years evil revisits the town of Derry, Maine, “It Chapter Two” brings the characters—who’ve long since gone their separate ways—back together as adults, nearly three decades after the events of the first film.  Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (“Zero Dark Thirty,” “Mama”) stars as Beverly, James McAvoy (“Split,” upcoming “Glass”) as Bill, Bill Hader (HBO’s “Barry,” “The Skeleton Twins”) as Richie, Isaiah Mustafa (TV’s “Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments”) as Mike, Jay Ryan (TV’s “Mary Kills People”) as Ben, James Ransone (HBO’s “The Wire”) as Eddie, and Andy Bean (“Allegiant,” Starz’ “Power”) as Stanley.  Reprising their roles as the original members of the Losers Club are Jaeden Martell as Bill, Wyatt Oleff as Stanley, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie, Finn Wolfhard as Richie, Sophia Lillis as Beverly, Chosen Jacobs as Mike, and Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben.  Bill Skarsgård returns in the seminal role of Pennywise.  Muschietti directed the film from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman (“IT,” “Annabelle: Creation”) based on the novel IT by Stephen King.  Barbara Muschietti, Dan Lin and Roy Lee produced the film, with Marty Ewing, Seth Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg serving as the executive producers.The behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Checco Varese (“The 33”), Oscar-winning production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“The Shape of Water”), editor Jason Ballantine (“IT,” “Mad Max: Fury Road”), and Oscar-nominated costume designer Luis Sequeira (“The Shape of Water,” “Mama”).  The music is by Benjamin Wallfisch (“Shazam!,” “Blade Runner 2049,” “IT”). New Line Cinema presents, a Vertigo Entertainment/Rideback Production, an Andy Muschietti film, “It Chapter Two.”  The film is slated for release in theaters and IMAX on September 6, 2019 and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures."

Amidst the racial and economic turmoil of the times, he writes poetry as a means to escape the intolerance of his hometown and the inflexibility of his traditional father.  But when a classmate introduces him to the music of “the Boss,” Javed sees parallels to his working-class life in Springsteen’s powerful lyrics.  As Javed discovers a cathartic outlet for his own pent-up dreams, he also begins to find the courage to express himself in his own unique voice.Based on Sarfraz Manzoor’s acclaimed memoir Greetings from Bury Park, “Blinded by the Light” is a joyful story of courage, love, hope, family and the unique ability of music to lift the human spirit.Chadha directed and produced the film, which was written by Manzoor, Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges.  The story is underscored by the music and poetic lyrics of Springsteen, who gave Chadha his blessing from the film’s inception.“Blinded by the Light” stars Viveik Kalra, Hayley Atwell, Rob Brydon, Kulvinder Ghir, Nell Williams, Dean-Charles Chapman, and Aaron Phagura.  The film was directed by Gurinder Chadha from a screenplay by Sarfraz Manzoor, Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges.  Jane Barclay, Chadha, and Jamal Daniel produced the film.

Salting the potatoes ahead of time draws out some of their liquid and guarantees they’re well seasoned, but skip this step if you want some of that moisture when you take a bite!Check out the recipe here:10 large eggsFreshly ground black pepper2 tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more2 lb. Yukon Gold potatoes (about 6), peeled, cut into ¼” slices2 cups extra-virgin olive oil1 large onion, halved, thinly sliced lengthwiseBeat eggs, pepper, and 1 tsp. salt in a large bowl; set aside.Pat potatoes dry with a clean towel. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook potatoes, turning occasionally, until tender, 8–10 minutes (you can cover the skillet in the beginning; the potatoes should be white, not brown). Add onions in batches and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4–6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer potato mixture to a rimmed baking sheet and let cool slightly. Strain oil into a heatproof bowl. Wipe out skillet.Beat eggs again until frothy. Add potato mixture to eggs; season with 1 tsp. salt. Heat ¼ cup reserved oil in same skillet over medium-high (chill remaining oil and reserve for another use). Add egg mixture, arranging potatoes to submerge. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, making sure potatoes are submerged but mostly undisturbed, until eggs are almost set and top is still slightly runny, 15–20 minutes.Invert tortilla onto a large plate, then slide back into skillet browned side up. Cook over medium heat until golden on the bottom and cooked through, about 5 minutes more.Cut into wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature.*Do Ahead:* Tortilla can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.Still haven’t subscribed to Bon Appetit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPnABOUT BON APPÉTITCook with confidence using Bon Appetit’s kitchen tips, recipes, videos, and restaurant guides.

Thankfully, using Wix, it's easy, accessible, and affordable too! Get your own URL, customize your layout, add key features like portfolios or shopping options (there are over 200 features to choose from!), and — of course — get creative! Follow the link to Wix at the top of the description to get started, or if you feel like you want some help, tweet me @mrkatedotcom your profile with the hashtag #CreativeWeirdoSpotlight and for the next Creative Weirdo Spotlight, we might be building your page! During some episodes of this series, Joey and I will be creating a custom website for one of you Creative Weirdos using Wix, and showing it off to the world! This episode, we featured Avi, an illustrator and animator! If you have a business or brand that you want to share with the world, don't stop at just social media pages! Make it official with a Wix website — because there's nothing more in the DIY spirit than creating a professional website yourself! _________________________Creative Credit: Audio Tracks - Epidemic Sound: http://share.epidemicsound.com/rGjgCA Mr. Kate ProductionExecutive Producers: Kate Albrecht and Joey ZehrAnimator: Avia Schelts-BrownEditor: Vianne Robitaille"

Today you are going to find out along with us, since we decided to take a DNA test and compare our results! Do you think we are identical?✅ Check out our adorable NEW B&B HAIR CLIPS HERE ➡ http://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com/clips We’ve really wanted to take a #DNAtest because we thought it would be HILARIOUS if our results didn’t come back exactly the same! We’ve been told that we are identical #twins our whole lives,  so it was super interesting getting the results back! The tests told us our genetic heritage by generation and location, as well as show us true and potential relatives out there who have taken the test before. It accurately predicted that our eye color, that we would have a strong likelihood to be able to match musical pitch, and it even predicted a daily wake-up time of 9:02 for us… it must not have known that we’ve been in early morning bible study for the past 4+ years! 😂Along with the #23andMe DNA test, we also took an #EverlyWell food sensitivity test, and those results ended up being interesting as well! Turns out, we don’t have any MAJOR food allergies or sensitivities, but there were a few mild ones that we found out about. Interestingly enough, our food sensitivities were similar, but not exactly the same. One of those being CHEDDAR CHEESE. I was literally heartbroken to find that out… buuuttt I don’t think that’ll stop me from eating it. Ya girl loves cheese!! 🧀In the end, the tests (not sponsored) did reveal that we ARE in fact identical although some mild environmental factors contribute to our subtle differences! 😂 Of course we already knew that, since our parents had us tested in clinical study when we were not quite one year old. It was still super fun, though, to take these tests and find out so much about ourselves, and our strange food sensitivities! Would you ever take a DNA test?? Where are your ancestors from?

The Dallas Cowboys are in Seattle and looking to take a lead over the Seahawks that could give them their first playoff win in ten years. They've had another year full of dysfunction, but finally look like they will shake out of the funk they've carried for the last decade.You know the disaster that follows, the career that had its wings clipped before it learned to fly, and the first step of a new journey that never seemed to stay on the path. But what about what came before that? So much had to fall perfectly so in order to make this moment what it is, and how it remains in our mind. The pain and heartbreak of an entire franchise, the fans forever divided over the quarterback, the lack of playoff success. It masked what led us to this moment. We forgot everything that raised hope so high and made the landing after the fall so much harder.

Through incredible drafting, timely trades, and contract wizardry by their GM, they had created a team that made 25-straight playoffs without ever needing to take time off to rebuild. And then it changed. The guys they leaned on to excel into their late 30s and early 40s began retiring. Their replacements began retiring. The free agents Detroit brought in to fill the void started signing elsewhere. The second-tier guys Detroit signed in their place didn’t produce. And the contracts given to them added up and prevented a youth movement from spreading its wings. The front office failed to catch on to a demise already underway and instead believed if they kept the streak alive and made the playoffs, then anything could happen. But finally, in 2017, they missed the postseason and began doing so in dramatic fashion. There’s finally hope with an old face for a new GM, but Holland put the team in enough cap hell it won’t be a quick recovery.Written and produced by Will BuikemaEdited by Alex HawleyShot by Mike ImhoffGraphics by Phil Pasternak-ERRORS-11:26 - 1997, not 1996Subscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com"

Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video (I posted this on all my social channels immediately after it happened)- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the “thieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn’t clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I’m really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that, I know my credibility is damaged but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I’ve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of “prank and like I mentioned in the video, it’s pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I’m especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn’t just taint the entire effort as “fake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I’ve built on my channel) and we’ve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I’m sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won’t happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

Anytime you have a sudden change in cross-sectional area in the horn you will get waves reflecting back at the source.  You don't want that because that is wasted energy that could have moved forward.  Even if it goes from a small cross-section to a larger, if you do it suddenly you get those wasted waves.  So you want the horn to basically be asymptotic at the exit so you never have a jump in discontinuity when it exits to the wide open air.  So a directors cone isn't as good as the curved shapes I showed because it still has the sudden change when it dumps into the open air.MUSIC-0:10- Arrow- Andrew Applepie - http://andrewapplepie.com/1:08- Dance- Danijel Zambo- https://danijel-zambo.bandcamp.com/2:00- Kalimba Jam- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/3:00- New shoes- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/7:30- Ceral Killa- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/8:47- Q- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/9:46 Too Happy to be cool by Notebreak- https://soundcloud.com/notebreak/dubstep-too-happy-to-be-coolSummary:  I made a huge horn and broke glass with it and explored why horns are shaped the way they are.MERCH-They are soft- https://teespring.com/stores/markroberPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub****************************************­I make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTubeFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTubeTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRoberINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/"

But why? Well, there are a number of reasons for this, so let’s break down the biggest and most recent problem first - Daenerys.In last night’s episode, Daenerys and Drogon rain fire down upon King’s Landing, killing thousands of innocents. This is all after Cersei’s armies have surrendered. Now the show’s writers justify this by claiming it’s the Mad King storyline coming full circle with his daughter. And, if the show had more episodes and time to develop this extreme choice, it could have made more sense. But we’re only given 6 episodes this season, as opposed to the usual 10, and the decision to make Daenerys the “Mad Queen” seems rushed and hasty.Throughout the seasons, we’ve seen Daenerys promise she’s nothing like her father, as she’s freed slaves and ruled mostly benevolently. So last night’s episode largely felt like a betrayal to both fans and her very character. An entire city going up in flames makes for a great visual, sure, but narratively it’s questionable. Now it appears Daenerys is the show’s “Big Bad,” and not Cersei.And that’s another big problem - Cersei and her fate. Fans were out for blood and wanted a gruesome end for the cold-hearted tyrant. But instead of getting a knife in the heart (like many predicted), she fell victim to rubble. Now one could argue that Daenerys ultimately killed Cersei...but her end still seems somewhat anticlimactic. And that doesn't even begin to address Jaime's problem.Jaime's redemption arc - where'd it go?! The Lannister most changed from a character standpoint after years of questioning his actions and his loyalty to his lover went back to his old ways all too quickly. In the previous episode, after leaving Brienne, fans had hoped he was on his way to King's Landing just to finish Cersei off himself. But this latest episode proved - NOPE! - he just wanted one last cuddle with his sister-lover. Hm.In conclusion, we only have 1 episode left, and frankly I’m excited to see where this all goes.GREEN SCREEN VERSION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZwkU6egd8M"

When the virus hit, The Division, a unit of civilian sleeper agents, was activated as the last line of defense. Since then, Division agents have been fighting relentlessly to save what remains.For The Division, the stakes are higher than ever. Washington, D.C. – the most heavily protected city on earth – is at risk, leaving the entire nation on the brink of collapse. If Washington, D.C., is lost, then the nation falls. As a Division agent who has been in the field for seven months, you and your team are the last hope to stop the fall of society after the pandemic collapse.Developed by Ubisoft Massive and the same teams that brought you Tom Clancy’s The Division®, Tom Clancy’s The Division® 2 is an online open world, action shooter RPG experience set in a collapsing and fractured Washington, D.C. This rich new setting combines a wide variety of beautiful, iconic, and realistic environments where the player will experience the series’ trademark for authenticity in world building, rich RPG systems, and fast-paced action like never before. Play solo or co-op with a team of up to four players to complete a wide range of activities, from the main campaign and adversarial PvP matches to the Dark Zone – where anything can happen.A TRANSFORMED WASHINGTON, D.C.In the wake of the virus, storms, flooding, and subsequent chaos have radically transformed Washington, D.C. Explore a living open world full of diverse environments, from flooded urban areas to historic sites and landmarks, during one of the hottest summers in history. The streets have been overrun with enemy factions, each with its own agenda and each vying for control of DC. It will be up to you to liberate the city and protect what remains of society.BEST-IN-CLASS ENDGAME EXPERIENCETom Clancy’s The Division 2 was built with an “endgame-first” mentality, ensuring players always have access to fresh, unique, and diverse activities long after completing the main campaign. Tom Clancy’s The Division 2’s endgame will introduce brand new challenges and progression systems, unique twists and surprises, and for the first time, raids. Players will also be able to access a wealth of post-launch content, including a full year of free additional story-driven missions, map expansions, and gameplay modes.REVAMPED PLAYER PROGRESSION AND NEW SPECIALIZATIONSAfter completing the main campaign, gain access to new specializations such as demolitionist, sharpshooter, and survivalist. Each specialization will open up an entire new progression system with new skills, mods, and unique talents to acquire and maximize your agent efficiency in your chosen role.DYNAMIC LIVING WORLDCivilians and enemy factions are constantly striving to survive, vying for necessities such as food, medicine, and ammunition. As the factions face off against each other in a ravaged DC, they will fight to seize control of resources and locations – and for their very survival. The various needs and motivations from each faction will collide, triggering different encounters between enemy and friendly factions, civilians, and ultimately you as an Agent, creating a dynamic living world full of surprises.UNITE THE CIVILIANSCivilians have banded together in settlements to rebuild their society, but their very existence is threatened. Work closely with them to keep them safe and in turn, they will come to your aid and provide supplies and assistance to build up your base of operations, giving a deeper meaning to the people and the world around you.A RENEWED DARK ZONE EXPERIENCEThe Dark Zone is an untamed area of the map with some of the best loot in the game. The Dark Zone is also the most dangerous area in the game, where fear, betrayal, and tension are high, as any other agent can turn against you and steal your hard-earned loot. In Tom Clancy’s The Division 2, this playground was designed to provide a fair and exciting experience to all players, regardless of their level of progression.The Division 2: Operation Dark Hours – How to Get Raid Ready | Ubisoft [NA]http://www.youtube.com/UbisoftNA"

Through Gary I met George Lowden and he started making my tour guitars for me, which were amazing both on stage and in the studio   We have been talking for years about trying to make a guitar that was as amazing as a Lowden but in a price point that was the same as the regular guitar companies, and also be made in Ireland. We never thought it was possible, but George and his team managed it   I’m so honoured to launch our new guitar brand, Sheeran guitars by Lowden. These are without a doubt the best guitars at their price point, and just a joy to play   Check out more at http://sheeranguitars.com, I hope you love them as much as me    Ed xFilmed & Edited by https://dogdaymedia.com/------------------Subscribe to Ed's channel: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToEdSheeranFollow Ed on...Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EdSheeranMusicTwitter: http://twitter.com/edsheeranInstagram: http://instagram.com/teddysphotosOfficial Website: http://edsheeran.com"

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves. Unfortunately, their newfound sense of normalcy will be short-lived, and their lives will be changed forever, as threats both old and new test their loyalties, push them past their limits, and make them question what it truly means to be human. First, they fought to survive. Then, they fought for their friends. Now, they will fight for the human race.

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.Flipchart artwork by Maria RaykovaFilmed by Raquel NunoThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci"

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com Colorful Animation 4 SeaweedAnd from Kevin MacLeod Marty Gots a PlanThis is an educational video about the science of water quality."

The Science Talent Search was founded and produced by the Society for Science and the Public.Huge thanks to the students: Ronak Roy, Ana Humphrey, and Anjali Chadha. It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.Filming by Raquel Nuno"

Aside from a desire to “change the rap game” as he put it on Twitter, the Florida native has a knack for crafting nuanced rhymes while keeping an eye on goal of mainstream success. Those two ideas don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Take his latest, “CLOUT COBAIN | CLOUT CO13A1N,” for example. For Vevo’s hip-hop performance series, we captured the upstart rapper in church on Manhattan's Upper West Side, waxing philosophically about the chase for mass appeal. The track is an early offering from his forthcoming project, ‘TA1300.’ Give it a listen and level up.
