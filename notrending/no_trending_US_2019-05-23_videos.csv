It seems that even from his earlier days there existed darkness within him, a darkness that only grew with time. I believe Euron is a psychopath. According to the dictionary, psychopathy is defined by impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits. The word psychopath does not imply delusional thought or irrational action. Euron thinks extremely highly of himself and is incapable of empathizing with other people. And now he seeks final Ascension. The Horn, Victarion, and Holy Men all seem key to Euron’s Grand Plan.Thanks for watching!Cover Art by: Bella Bergolts: https://bergolts.artstation.com/projects/OV6dwPlease consider supporting this channel on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ideasoficeandfireThe Book I helped write: https://www.amazon.com/Thrones-Effect-HBOs-Conquered-Culture/dp/0998029947/ref=sr_1_1?crid=A2RMTG1N5WWR&keywords=the+thrones+effect&qid=1558142871&s=gateway&sprefix=thrones+eff%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRELike me on Facebook!: https://www.facebook.com/IOIAFFeel free to leave a comment like and subscribe!Thanks For Watching!"

Through Gary I met George Lowden and he started making my tour guitars for me, which were amazing both on stage and in the studio   We have been talking for years about trying to make a guitar that was as amazing as a Lowden but in a price point that was the same as the regular guitar companies, and also be made in Ireland. We never thought it was possible, but George and his team managed it   I’m so honoured to launch our new guitar brand, Sheeran guitars by Lowden. These are without a doubt the best guitars at their price point, and just a joy to play   Check out more at http://sheeranguitars.com, I hope you love them as much as me    Ed xFilmed & Edited by https://dogdaymedia.com/------------------Subscribe to Ed's channel: http://bit.ly/SubscribeToEdSheeranFollow Ed on...Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EdSheeranMusicTwitter: http://twitter.com/edsheeranInstagram: http://instagram.com/teddysphotosOfficial Website: http://edsheeran.com"

Salting the potatoes ahead of time draws out some of their liquid and guarantees they’re well seasoned, but skip this step if you want some of that moisture when you take a bite!Check out the recipe here:10 large eggsFreshly ground black pepper2 tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more2 lb. Yukon Gold potatoes (about 6), peeled, cut into ¼” slices2 cups extra-virgin olive oil1 large onion, halved, thinly sliced lengthwiseBeat eggs, pepper, and 1 tsp. salt in a large bowl; set aside.Pat potatoes dry with a clean towel. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook potatoes, turning occasionally, until tender, 8–10 minutes (you can cover the skillet in the beginning; the potatoes should be white, not brown). Add onions in batches and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4–6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer potato mixture to a rimmed baking sheet and let cool slightly. Strain oil into a heatproof bowl. Wipe out skillet.Beat eggs again until frothy. Add potato mixture to eggs; season with 1 tsp. salt. Heat ¼ cup reserved oil in same skillet over medium-high (chill remaining oil and reserve for another use). Add egg mixture, arranging potatoes to submerge. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, making sure potatoes are submerged but mostly undisturbed, until eggs are almost set and top is still slightly runny, 15–20 minutes.Invert tortilla onto a large plate, then slide back into skillet browned side up. Cook over medium heat until golden on the bottom and cooked through, about 5 minutes more.Cut into wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature.*Do Ahead:* Tortilla can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature.Still haven’t subscribed to Bon Appetit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPnABOUT BON APPÉTITCook with confidence using Bon Appetit’s kitchen tips, recipes, videos, and restaurant guides.

The Dallas Cowboys are in Seattle and looking to take a lead over the Seahawks that could give them their first playoff win in ten years. They've had another year full of dysfunction, but finally look like they will shake out of the funk they've carried for the last decade.You know the disaster that follows, the career that had its wings clipped before it learned to fly, and the first step of a new journey that never seemed to stay on the path. But what about what came before that? So much had to fall perfectly so in order to make this moment what it is, and how it remains in our mind. The pain and heartbreak of an entire franchise, the fans forever divided over the quarterback, the lack of playoff success. It masked what led us to this moment. We forgot everything that raised hope so high and made the landing after the fall so much harder.

What he ended up building was a little different. This Scirocco is powered with help from a USF3 racing engine, has a full roll cage, and one of the coolest paint jobs we’ve ever seen.

Please see my comments below with regards to reports the video was partially faked.  Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video (I posted this on all my social channels immediately after it happened)- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the “thieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn’t clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I’m really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that, I know my credibility is damaged but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I’ve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of “prank and like I mentioned in the video, it’s pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I’m especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn’t just taint the entire effort as “fake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I’ve built on my channel) and we’ve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I’m sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won’t happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

They rent high speed cameras at killer prices.  Hit them up.ELI20 version:  I answered why you want a large outlet area but not necessarily why it curves like that.  Anytime you have a sudden change in cross-sectional area in the horn you will get waves reflecting back at the source.  You don't want that because that is wasted energy that could have moved forward.  Even if it goes from a small cross-section to a larger, if you do it suddenly you get those wasted waves.  So you want the horn to basically be asymptotic at the exit so you never have a jump in discontinuity when it exits to the wide open air.  So a directors cone isn't as good as the curved shapes I showed because it still has the sudden change when it dumps into the open air.MUSIC-0:10- Arrow- Andrew Applepie - http://andrewapplepie.com/1:08- Dance- Danijel Zambo- https://danijel-zambo.bandcamp.com/2:00- Kalimba Jam- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/3:00- New shoes- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/7:30- Ceral Killa- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/8:47- Q- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/9:46 Too Happy to be cool by Notebreak- https://soundcloud.com/notebreak/dubstep-too-happy-to-be-coolSummary:  I made a huge horn and broke glass with it and explored why horns are shaped the way they are.MERCH-They are soft- https://teespring.com/stores/markroberPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub****************************************­I make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTubeFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTubeTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRoberINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/"

Both redefining and transcending the genre, “IT” became part of the cultural zeitgeist as well as the highest-grossing horror film of all time.Because every 27 years evil revisits the town of Derry, Maine, “It Chapter Two” brings the characters—who’ve long since gone their separate ways—back together as adults, nearly three decades after the events of the first film.  Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (“Zero Dark Thirty,” “Mama”) stars as Beverly, James McAvoy (“Split,” upcoming “Glass”) as Bill, Bill Hader (HBO’s “Barry,” “The Skeleton Twins”) as Richie, Isaiah Mustafa (TV’s “Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments”) as Mike, Jay Ryan (TV’s “Mary Kills People”) as Ben, James Ransone (HBO’s “The Wire”) as Eddie, and Andy Bean (“Allegiant,” Starz’ “Power”) as Stanley.  Reprising their roles as the original members of the Losers Club are Jaeden Martell as Bill, Wyatt Oleff as Stanley, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie, Finn Wolfhard as Richie, Sophia Lillis as Beverly, Chosen Jacobs as Mike, and Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben.  Bill Skarsgård returns in the seminal role of Pennywise.  Muschietti directed the film from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman (“IT,” “Annabelle: Creation”) based on the novel IT by Stephen King.  Barbara Muschietti, Dan Lin and Roy Lee produced the film, with Marty Ewing, Seth Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg serving as the executive producers.The behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Checco Varese (“The 33”), Oscar-winning production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“The Shape of Water”), editor Jason Ballantine (“IT,” “Mad Max: Fury Road”), and Oscar-nominated costume designer Luis Sequeira (“The Shape of Water,” “Mama”).  The music is by Benjamin Wallfisch (“Shazam!,” “Blade Runner 2049,” “IT”). New Line Cinema presents, a Vertigo Entertainment/Rideback Production, an Andy Muschietti film, “It Chapter Two.”  The film is slated for release in theaters and IMAX on September 6, 2019 and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures."

Amidst the racial and economic turmoil of the times, he writes poetry as a means to escape the intolerance of his hometown and the inflexibility of his traditional father.  But when a classmate introduces him to the music of “the Boss,” Javed sees parallels to his working-class life in Springsteen’s powerful lyrics.  As Javed discovers a cathartic outlet for his own pent-up dreams, he also begins to find the courage to express himself in his own unique voice.Based on Sarfraz Manzoor’s acclaimed memoir Greetings from Bury Park, “Blinded by the Light” is a joyful story of courage, love, hope, family and the unique ability of music to lift the human spirit.Chadha directed and produced the film, which was written by Manzoor, Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges.  The story is underscored by the music and poetic lyrics of Springsteen, who gave Chadha his blessing from the film’s inception.“Blinded by the Light” stars Viveik Kalra, Hayley Atwell, Rob Brydon, Kulvinder Ghir, Nell Williams, Dean-Charles Chapman, and Aaron Phagura.  The film was directed by Gurinder Chadha from a screenplay by Sarfraz Manzoor, Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges.  Jane Barclay, Chadha, and Jamal Daniel produced the film.

Subscribe to ScreenRant for more videos: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-ScreenrantThe fans have spoken. And if there’s one thing we know for sure, people have wildly different opinions about how well Game of Thrones ended. So - when the ash cleared, were you in love with the decisions made by our showrunners, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss? Do you believe they stayed true to George R. R. Martin’s initial vision or did they sully all the solid worldbuilding and gutsy storytelling that so defined Westeros throughout much of 8 year run? We here at ScreenRant are sifting through the online praise and vitriol. We’re listening to all the spiders online spreading both thoughtful criticism and loud dissent. And by the end of this video, we’ll come close to determining why, oh why so many fans felt the last six (or more) episodes fell flatter than the Red Keep at the end of “The Bells.” Apparently, even the GOT cast was taken by surprise. And although Daenerys has been teasing her relentless fury for years, most of us were surprised by the extent of her quest for vengeance. Sure, this is the same woman who said “I will take what is mine, with fire and blood I will take it.” But geez, did we think she’d go this far? Maybe we didn’t expect this because of poor writing? Or perhaps the same sloppy mistakes - that allowed coffee cups and water bottles to make it into the final cuts of episodes - were to blame? Whether you hated the rushed pacing or were thrown by the change in style, join us as we decide whether this series ultimately ends up among the ranks of the white book or should get booted out the moon door.Our Social Media:https://twitter.com/screenranthttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRanthttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRantOur Websitehttp://screenrant.com/"

This video (and this passage of text) has major spoilers for Avengers: Endgame, so if you STILL haven't seen the movie, don't watch it and don't read on!Thanos is no more in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The Mad Titan with the prune-like chin was killed-off in Avengers: Endgame - twice, as a matter of fact! - having been built-up for seven years as the big-bad of the franchise.And while Marvel Studios seemingly played the long game with the character, the evidence actually proves they didn't plan as far ahead as you might have thought.As a result, Thanos' introduction was flawed, with a number of inconsistencies that didn't make sense along the way.In this video, we'll tell you why his introduction made no sense and what should've been done to make it better.Joss Whedon didn't even know why he was introducing Thanos in that Avengers mid-credits scene back in 2012 - he just needed someone to act as Loki's boss.As a result, his motives weren't laid out and, in conjunctions with inconsistencies related to the MCU Infinity Gauntlet, a number of problems arose with regards to the Mad Titan.You'll have to watch the video to find out more - and indeed what we'd have done to rectify the situation.We hope you enjoy the video!

Subscribe to our channel for more awesome videos: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-ScreenrantYou think you have problems with the ending of Game of Thrones? Well, you didn’t have to act in it! In all seriousness, Game of Thrones has got to be an emotionally draining experience for its cast as they get beaten up on the battlefield, tossed around by crew members standing-in for dragons and made to conjure huge emotions for all the devastating moments we witnessed during its eight season-run. Whether you love the show’s finale or despise the way things wrapped up, there’s definitely something in Game of Thrones for everyone - cast, crew, and fans included. So join ScreenRant as we look at some of the statements that many of the show’s stars and personalities - long-lived and short-lived - made about this fantasy phenomenon.We’ll check in with Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage, Nikolaj Coster Waldau, Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner, Ian McElhinney, Conleth Hill, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jerome Flynn, Gwendoline Christie, Isaac Hempstead Wright, John Bradley, Liam Cunningham, Jacob Anderson, Pilou Asbaek, Kristofer Hivju, Rory McCann, and even George R. R. Martin. Sure, there are supercuts clogging the internet, edited in such a way to make us think we know how these GOT cast members felt about the end of the show. But let’s find out how they truly feel. Just like how George R. R. Martin probably has a few surprises up his sleeves before the final books come out, we likely don’t know about everything that went on behind the scenes. But perhaps this video will give you a better idea of how these actors felt.

Seriously, we know fans always like to find something to complain about and the bigger a franchise is the more dissenters are going to show up out of the woodwork to voice their opinions. But we’re going to go over everything wrong with the final episode of season eight because it really was that bad. This isn’t a mere case of us not getting the exact ending we wanted and complaining about it because we have a YouTube channel and we can do this.Let’s talk about some of the major players who didn’t even make it to the final episode. Not only did we not get sweet, sweet, revenge on Cersei Lannister but we said goodbye to her way too soon. Same with the character arc of Jaime Lannister, the entire Lord of Light prophecy, and pretty much everything else which had been built up over the previous episodes. We learned that Jon Snow still knows nothing despite going through so much and we got to see Arya Stark put an end to her career of vengeance by wandering away into the wilderness.What do you think about the season finale of Game of Thrones?

Today, I'm gonna bring you guys along with me to paint over my old, boring cloth organizers. They're pretty plain and white and since I'm going for a very colorful look in my new art room, I thought I could give them a little makeover.I'm in the process of decorating my whole art room, so if you like this video, I may do more like this.These are the typical Ikea cube shelves that everyone and their mother has. I felt like this was something good to share with everyone because I've never seen anyone else do this, and I think it is a pretty easy way to put a personal touch on a room.Obviously you wouldn't have to do this as obnoxiously as me lol. You could be more subdued and classy with it. Or use stencils and whatnot if you don't want to free-hand it.TIPS:Fabric paint works really great on these, but if you can’t find fabric paint, make sure you at least use a paint that is flexible so that it doesn’t crack when you're dragging these in and out of the shelves. Probably not best to use something like acrylic paint. Unless you combine it with a fabric medium.WHAT YOU NEED:1. Cube Shelf  (I’m using the Kallax Shelf from Ikea)2. Cloth box insert (or you can use wooden bins)3. Fabric Paint (switch with acrylic paint if using wooden bins)Im thinking about how to decorate the remaining 4. Not sure if I should do them in the same theme, a different theme or STORAGE BINS (affiliate link):https://amzn.to/2JfiPh4VIDEO FACTS:–If you notice on my very “MESSY” plan, I was going to do metallic accents….obviously I changed my mind about that. I just decided I didn’t want that look…..–I wanted them to each be unique in the own way, but unify them with color. they all have a light rainbow, a dark rainbow and white accents.–I decided not to paint the sides, back or inside of the boxes (only the front) because1. Those areas aren’t visible unless the bin is open and 2.

Today is another squishy makeover, obviously. I took care of the soft n slo cat with the tail, a unicorn (i mean, alicorn ugh) hugging on the moon, and a little surprise resident for my cottage from last episode (as promised). I had some struggles as usual, but I think overall they came out well. Do you like them?!?!?!Welcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...VIDEO FACTS:–I did the whole showing while editing thing for the first time. I have recently been using clips of my face from old videos to give facial reactions but I got tired of sifting through old footage, so i just quickly filmed those bits on my computer. not sure how i feel about it yet, or if it'll be a thing. i know a lot of other youtubers are doing that now also, so ehhh idk. after reading the comments, some people seemed to like it, some people didnt. we'll see! –Apparently having a male calico cat is super rare. A lot of people are saying it's impossible in the comments, BUT i looked it up and actually its just uncommon. About 1 in 3,000 calico cats are male. So he's jus special then haha :)–based on the comments, the bear in the bunny costume is a koala? I would have never guessed that in a million years. How are those koala ears!?!? And why is there a rim around the face as if its wearing a costume?! I have no clue. but a lot of ya'll are saying it, so I guess it is a koala. sure?? ________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. 8.

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.Flipchart artwork by Maria RaykovaFilmed by Raquel NunoThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci"

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com Colorful Animation 4 SeaweedAnd from Kevin MacLeod Marty Gots a PlanThis is an educational video about the science of water quality."

The Science Talent Search was founded and produced by the Society for Science and the Public.Huge thanks to the students: Ronak Roy, Ana Humphrey, and Anjali Chadha. It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.Filming by Raquel Nuno"

We love y'all. It was only right that our boy LaMelo Ball became the first person besides Larry to host the OT Challenge. Thing is, he hosted Larry...So here's what happened. Larry was minding his business in LA when he got attacked, blindfolded, and taken to the secret BBB Mansion in Cali. We still don't know the addy...Who was it that kidnapped him? LaMelo. The reason? Larry been putting all these high schoolers through the challenge without doing it himself. Makes no sense.Melo ran Larry through the obstacle course, speed questions, the Ocky challenge, Beat Melo, and more. You gotta watch this!!!Should LaMelo host the challenge from now on, or do we keep Larry??

But why? Well, there are a number of reasons for this, so let’s break down the biggest and most recent problem first - Daenerys.In last night’s episode, Daenerys and Drogon rain fire down upon King’s Landing, killing thousands of innocents. This is all after Cersei’s armies have surrendered. Now the show’s writers justify this by claiming it’s the Mad King storyline coming full circle with his daughter. And, if the show had more episodes and time to develop this extreme choice, it could have made more sense. But we’re only given 6 episodes this season, as opposed to the usual 10, and the decision to make Daenerys the “Mad Queen” seems rushed and hasty.Throughout the seasons, we’ve seen Daenerys promise she’s nothing like her father, as she’s freed slaves and ruled mostly benevolently. So last night’s episode largely felt like a betrayal to both fans and her very character. An entire city going up in flames makes for a great visual, sure, but narratively it’s questionable. Now it appears Daenerys is the show’s “Big Bad,” and not Cersei.And that’s another big problem - Cersei and her fate. Fans were out for blood and wanted a gruesome end for the cold-hearted tyrant. But instead of getting a knife in the heart (like many predicted), she fell victim to rubble. Now one could argue that Daenerys ultimately killed Cersei...but her end still seems somewhat anticlimactic. And that doesn't even begin to address Jaime's problem.Jaime's redemption arc - where'd it go?! The Lannister most changed from a character standpoint after years of questioning his actions and his loyalty to his lover went back to his old ways all too quickly. In the previous episode, after leaving Brienne, fans had hoped he was on his way to King's Landing just to finish Cersei off himself. But this latest episode proved - NOPE! - he just wanted one last cuddle with his sister-lover. Hm.In conclusion, we only have 1 episode left, and frankly I’m excited to see where this all goes.GREEN SCREEN VERSION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZwkU6egd8M"

It honestly feels like we just moved in at Baylor… where do you think we will live when we go back???It felt like #moving out of our apartment took FOREVER… with two of us, we just have SO MUCH stuff! A lot of the #Freshman kids that were moving out of their dorms had like, one bed and a few boxes of clothes and school supplies. Then there’s us... hauling out of our #dorm a family's worth of furniture and home decor! 😂 Plus, we had stuff for 2 students, not just 1! We made so many awesome friends at Baylor, a few of which helped us load up our car, and haul it to a storage unit! Nothing makes you feel more like an adult than moving out WITHOUT your parents, and finding and renting your own storage unit! We’re doing some serious adulting, y’all! 🙈Telling our friends goodbye for the summer was actually a lot harder than we anticipated. I know we’ll see them again in 3 months, but it’s still difficult to say goodbye to our freshman year and the memories tied to it. It’s kind of like the end of an era, especially since when we go back we will be starting as college juniors in Baylor's business program! (We might not see as much of our Freshman friends as we did this year since we will be a year ahead.)As much as we're going to miss our friends over the summer, I will NOT be missing Business Calculus! We are SO excited to have a break from our tough 18-credit class schedule, and will be able to enjoy the summer with our family! (Paisley missed us, I am sure!)Also, a HUGE thank you to Jeffrey, Antoine, Anna, Brad, Sean, Tina, Cameron, Jensen, who helped us move out!! When do you finish school for the summer?

I didn't include names, I hope that's ok...! Most of the notes were really short so I didn't want to slow down the pacing, and a few people asked to be anonymous anyway so I was like...aiight we'll keep the flow going and just read thru. So thank you, everyone, who sent something in! I'm sorry I couldn't include them all ;-; But my heart and soul was just so freakin full after reading these. You made me laugh, think, smile, feel loved! So if any of these messages touch you, thank your fellow humans ^_^Sleep well, all!🎵I’m now on Spotify!

He explained to us how he used sound to bring them to life, from Hardhome to the Battle of Winterfell, and went through some of the show's most memorable moments, from the Night King's early appearances, to the first time Cersei and the rest of King's Landing came face-to-face with a wight.Thanks to Tim Kimmel for speaking with us!

Audiences were divided over both of the seminal battles in season 8: the Battle of King’s Landing (episode 5, “The Bells”) and the Battle of Winterfell (episode 3, “The Long Night”). We compare these two landmark war sequences and analyze what worked — and what didn’t — in each. And we answer the question of which one was better, making a strong case for the Battle of Winterfell. Here’s why the clash between the Living and the Dead at Winterfell far surpassed Daenerys’s attack on King’s Landing — in terms of both plot and execution.MORE GAME OF THRONES CONTENT:81 Details In 'Game Of Thrones' Season 8 You Might Have Missedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYMNMa2epFoHow 'Game Of Thrones' Created The Most Epic Battle Scene In TV Historyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKqdK1yavu416 Clues Foreshadowing Arya’s Big Moment In ‘Game Of Thrones’ Season 8 Episode 3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DthX08zjLo------------------------------------------------------#GameOfThrones #GoT #INSIDERINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

I never thought that we would see a tiny house which has quite so many solar panels on the roof. Amazingly, this tiny house has a 4kw solar array with 36kw of lead acid battery storage, allowing the family to power not just their home (including all the modern appliances) but also a tiny house building workshop! Become a Living Big Patron and help us to create more videos: https://www.patreon.com/livingbigThe home was constructed as a DIY build by Glade and Cloe, with the vast majority of all the materials being found in the hard rubbish. With all the labour done by the couple, and with the building materials mostly up-cycled and recycled, the home was constructed for an amazing price of only AU$10,000!

Glade has started his own tiny house construction business which operates from his property, allowing him to spend time at home with his family. Their home is packed full of clever design ideas and is definitely one to check out. I hope you enjoy the video tour of this stunning off the grid tiny house.

Thankfully, using Wix, it's easy, accessible, and affordable too! Get your own URL, customize your layout, add key features like portfolios or shopping options (there are over 200 features to choose from!), and — of course — get creative! Follow the link to Wix at the top of the description to get started, or if you feel like you want some help, tweet me @mrkatedotcom your profile with the hashtag #CreativeWeirdoSpotlight and for the next Creative Weirdo Spotlight, we might be building your page! During some episodes of this series, Joey and I will be creating a custom website for one of you Creative Weirdos using Wix, and showing it off to the world! This episode, we featured Avi, an illustrator and animator! If you have a business or brand that you want to share with the world, don't stop at just social media pages! Make it official with a Wix website — because there's nothing more in the DIY spirit than creating a professional website yourself! _________________________Creative Credit: Audio Tracks - Epidemic Sound: http://share.epidemicsound.com/rGjgCA Mr. Kate ProductionExecutive Producers: Kate Albrecht and Joey ZehrAnimator: Avia Schelts-BrownEditor: Vianne Robitaille"

They still fight crime and face classic villains, but mainly deal with all the issues of five teens rooming together -- chores, romantic tension, demon dad drop-ins and impromptu meatball parties.  They also dance! The emphasis is on the odd everyday life of super heroes who haven't grown up.Visit Teen Titans GO!
