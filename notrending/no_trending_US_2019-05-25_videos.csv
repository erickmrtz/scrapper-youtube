Thankfully, using Wix, it's easy, accessible, and affordable too! Get your own URL, customize your layout, add key features like portfolios or shopping options (there are over 200 features to choose from!), and — of course — get creative! Follow the link to Wix at the top of the description to get started, or if you feel like you want some help, tweet me @mrkatedotcom your profile with the hashtag #CreativeWeirdoSpotlight and for the next Creative Weirdo Spotlight, we might be building your page! During some episodes of this series, Joey and I will be creating a custom website for one of you Creative Weirdos using Wix, and showing it off to the world! This episode, we featured Avi, an illustrator and animator! If you have a business or brand that you want to share with the world, don't stop at just social media pages! Make it official with a Wix website — because there's nothing more in the DIY spirit than creating a professional website yourself! _________________________Creative Credit: Audio Tracks - Epidemic Sound: http://share.epidemicsound.com/rGjgCA Mr. Kate ProductionExecutive Producers: Kate Albrecht and Joey ZehrAnimator: Avia Schelts-BrownEditor: Vianne Robitaille"

It seems that even from his earlier days there existed darkness within him, a darkness that only grew with time. I believe Euron is a psychopath. According to the dictionary, psychopathy is defined by impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits. The word psychopath does not imply delusional thought or irrational action. Euron thinks extremely highly of himself and is incapable of empathizing with other people. And now he seeks final Ascension. The Horn, Victarion, and Holy Men all seem key to Euron’s Grand Plan.Thanks for watching!Cover Art by: Bella Bergolts: https://bergolts.artstation.com/projects/OV6dwPlease consider supporting this channel on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ideasoficeandfireThe Book I helped write: https://www.amazon.com/Thrones-Effect-HBOs-Conquered-Culture/dp/0998029947/ref=sr_1_1?crid=A2RMTG1N5WWR&keywords=the+thrones+effect&qid=1558142871&s=gateway&sprefix=thrones+eff%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRELike me on Facebook!: https://www.facebook.com/IOIAFFeel free to leave a comment like and subscribe!Thanks For Watching!"

One thing that makes them so terrifying: sound. We spoke with Tim Kimmel, the show's Emmy winning supervising sound editor. He explained to us how he used sound to bring them to life, from Hardhome to the Battle of Winterfell, and went through some of the show's most memorable moments, from the Night King's early appearances, to the first time Cersei and the rest of King's Landing came face-to-face with a wight.Thanks to Tim Kimmel for speaking with us!

Audiences were divided over both of the seminal battles in season 8: the Battle of King’s Landing (episode 5, “The Bells”) and the Battle of Winterfell (episode 3, “The Long Night”). We compare these two landmark war sequences and analyze what worked — and what didn’t — in each. And we answer the question of which one was better, making a strong case for the Battle of Winterfell. Here’s why the clash between the Living and the Dead at Winterfell far surpassed Daenerys’s attack on King’s Landing — in terms of both plot and execution.MORE GAME OF THRONES CONTENT:81 Details In 'Game Of Thrones' Season 8 You Might Have Missedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYMNMa2epFoHow 'Game Of Thrones' Created The Most Epic Battle Scene In TV Historyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKqdK1yavu416 Clues Foreshadowing Arya’s Big Moment In ‘Game Of Thrones’ Season 8 Episode 3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DthX08zjLo------------------------------------------------------#GameOfThrones #GoT #INSIDERINSIDER is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the “thieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn’t clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I’m really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that, I know my credibility is damaged but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I’ve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of “prank and like I mentioned in the video, it’s pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I’m especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn’t just taint the entire effort as “fake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I’ve built on my channel) and we’ve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I’m sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won’t happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

They rent high speed cameras at killer prices.  Hit them up.ELI20 version:  I answered why you want a large outlet area but not necessarily why it curves like that.  Anytime you have a sudden change in cross-sectional area in the horn you will get waves reflecting back at the source.  You don't want that because that is wasted energy that could have moved forward.  Even if it goes from a small cross-section to a larger, if you do it suddenly you get those wasted waves.  So you want the horn to basically be asymptotic at the exit so you never have a jump in discontinuity when it exits to the wide open air.  So a directors cone isn't as good as the curved shapes I showed because it still has the sudden change when it dumps into the open air.MUSIC-0:10- Arrow- Andrew Applepie - http://andrewapplepie.com/1:08- Dance- Danijel Zambo- https://danijel-zambo.bandcamp.com/2:00- Kalimba Jam- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/3:00- New shoes- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/7:30- Ceral Killa- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/8:47- Q- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/9:46 Too Happy to be cool by Notebreak- https://soundcloud.com/notebreak/dubstep-too-happy-to-be-coolSummary:  I made a huge horn and broke glass with it and explored why horns are shaped the way they are.MERCH-They are soft- https://teespring.com/stores/markroberPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub****************************************­I make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTubeFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTubeTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRoberINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/"

Today is another squishy makeover, obviously. I took on a couple really unique ones today. Actually kinda scary....and creepy. Plus one super basic one LOL. Which makeover do you like best?Also. The Koala issue that I mentioned about my LAST makeover video (this is serious). I really don't think that squishy was a koala. Koalas have rounded ears (the squishy had long floppy ears aka a BUNNY COSTUME) and vertical noses (that squishy had a very horizontal nose: BEAR). It also had a very pronounced rim around the face (You can see it in the version I showed today, since it's a COSTUME!) Anddd it was otherwise just plain so i have no idea why most people said it was a koala. But, LET THE DEBATE BEGIN! hahahahaWelcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!I always try to give painting tips and advice, while trying to make i fun.WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...BAKING VIDEOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQIQMIZWG-Y&list=PL807ptvhwHpciWBzyd5NsZcWMRbwBGSFbVIDEO FACTS:–The ballet video of me I showed was from 2012. I was in 11th grade. I love how they edited the recording to zoom out when I fell. Trying to take attention away from the fact I literally fell on my butt haha________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. 8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit. I spend multiple weeks working on them (in combination with my other videos) so it’s not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my art and craft videos as well ☺___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Today, I'm gonna bring you guys along with me to paint over my old, boring cloth organizers. They're pretty plain and white and since I'm going for a very colorful look in my new art room, I thought I could give them a little makeover.I'm in the process of decorating my whole art room, so if you like this video, I may do more like this.These are the typical Ikea cube shelves that everyone and their mother has. I felt like this was something good to share with everyone because I've never seen anyone else do this, and I think it is a pretty easy way to put a personal touch on a room.Obviously you wouldn't have to do this as obnoxiously as me lol. You could be more subdued and classy with it. Or use stencils and whatnot if you don't want to free-hand it.TIPS:Fabric paint works really great on these, but if you can’t find fabric paint, make sure you at least use a paint that is flexible so that it doesn’t crack when you're dragging these in and out of the shelves. Probably not best to use something like acrylic paint. Unless you combine it with a fabric medium.WHAT YOU NEED:1. Cube Shelf  (I’m using the Kallax Shelf from Ikea)2. Cloth box insert (or you can use wooden bins)3. Fabric Paint (switch with acrylic paint if using wooden bins)Im thinking about how to decorate the remaining 4. Not sure if I should do them in the same theme, a different theme or STORAGE BINS (affiliate link):https://amzn.to/2JfiPh4VIDEO FACTS:–If you notice on my very “MESSY” plan, I was going to do metallic accents….obviously I changed my mind about that. I just decided I didn’t want that look…..–I wanted them to each be unique in the own way, but unify them with color. they all have a light rainbow, a dark rainbow and white accents.–I decided not to paint the sides, back or inside of the boxes (only the front) because1. Those areas aren’t visible unless the bin is open and 2. I didn’t want the paint on the outside to stick to the shelf___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)•FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.Flipchart artwork by Maria RaykovaFilmed by Raquel NunoThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci"

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com Colorful Animation 4 SeaweedAnd from Kevin MacLeod Marty Gots a PlanThis is an educational video about the science of water quality."

It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.Filming by Raquel Nuno"

It honestly feels like we just moved in at Baylor… where do you think we will live when we go back???It felt like #moving out of our apartment took FOREVER… with two of us, we just have SO MUCH stuff! A lot of the #Freshman kids that were moving out of their dorms had like, one bed and a few boxes of clothes and school supplies. Then there’s us... hauling out of our #dorm a family's worth of furniture and home decor! 😂 Plus, we had stuff for 2 students, not just 1! We made so many awesome friends at Baylor, a few of which helped us load up our car, and haul it to a storage unit! Nothing makes you feel more like an adult than moving out WITHOUT your parents, and finding and renting your own storage unit! We’re doing some serious adulting, y’all! 🙈Telling our friends goodbye for the summer was actually a lot harder than we anticipated. I know we’ll see them again in 3 months, but it’s still difficult to say goodbye to our freshman year and the memories tied to it. It’s kind of like the end of an era, especially since when we go back we will be starting as college juniors in Baylor's business program! (We might not see as much of our Freshman friends as we did this year since we will be a year ahead.)As much as we're going to miss our friends over the summer, I will NOT be missing Business Calculus! We are SO excited to have a break from our tough 18-credit class schedule, and will be able to enjoy the summer with our family! (Paisley missed us, I am sure!)Also, a HUGE thank you to Jeffrey, Antoine, Anna, Brad, Sean, Tina, Cameron, Jensen, who helped us move out!! When do you finish school for the summer?

We went all out too, I even gave her all of my jewelry AND she wore hair extensions to look as much like me as possible… It was kind of scary how much she looked like me!! 😂 what do you think???We even asked Asa (Bailey’s #boyfriend) to be a part of it, and y’all will never believe what happened during the video with him… 🙈We were so laughing SO HARD!!You can’t help but feel so bad for him… but don’t blame Asa for not noticing, he got Bailey back a few days later and she didn’t notice he switched with one of our friends who looks a lot like him, during a photo shoot! What can they say??? They’ve been dating long distance for over 2 years and don’t spend a lot of time physically together!Who were you the MOST surprised by that didn’t notice we switched places?

Each semester, there are formals to attend, where you basically just get super dressed up, find a date, and go dance with all of your friends! This year, the way that our scheduling worked out, Brooklyn & I weren’t able to both attend Chi Omega’s formal (Brooklyn was in NY at the YouTube Creator Summit)!

Grizzly, Panda and Ice Bear are masters of the selfie, fans of the food truck, and chasers of internet fame. While fairly savvy about the modern world, they always seem to find their way in to wild adventures and hilarious trouble. Grizzly, the oldest bear, leads his younger brothers, Panda and Ice Bear, with endless optimism that tends to result in disaster. We Bare Bears is created by Annie Award-winner, Daniel Chong and produced by Cartoon Network Studios.About Cartoon Network:Welcome to Cartoon Network's YouTube Channel, your destination for episode clips, behind the scenes footage, how to draw tutorials, toy videos, and more!

Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn: from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves.

But why? Well, there are a number of reasons for this, so let’s break down the biggest and most recent problem first - Daenerys.In last night’s episode, Daenerys and Drogon rain fire down upon King’s Landing, killing thousands of innocents. This is all after Cersei’s armies have surrendered. Now the show’s writers justify this by claiming it’s the Mad King storyline coming full circle with his daughter. And, if the show had more episodes and time to develop this extreme choice, it could have made more sense. But we’re only given 6 episodes this season, as opposed to the usual 10, and the decision to make Daenerys the “Mad Queen” seems rushed and hasty.Throughout the seasons, we’ve seen Daenerys promise she’s nothing like her father, as she’s freed slaves and ruled mostly benevolently. So last night’s episode largely felt like a betrayal to both fans and her very character. An entire city going up in flames makes for a great visual, sure, but narratively it’s questionable. Now it appears Daenerys is the show’s “Big Bad,” and not Cersei.And that’s another big problem - Cersei and her fate. Fans were out for blood and wanted a gruesome end for the cold-hearted tyrant. But instead of getting a knife in the heart (like many predicted), she fell victim to rubble. Now one could argue that Daenerys ultimately killed Cersei...but her end still seems somewhat anticlimactic. And that doesn't even begin to address Jaime's problem.Jaime's redemption arc - where'd it go?! The Lannister most changed from a character standpoint after years of questioning his actions and his loyalty to his lover went back to his old ways all too quickly. In the previous episode, after leaving Brienne, fans had hoped he was on his way to King's Landing just to finish Cersei off himself. But this latest episode proved - NOPE! - he just wanted one last cuddle with his sister-lover. Hm.In conclusion, we only have 1 episode left, and frankly I’m excited to see where this all goes.GREEN SCREEN VERSION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZwkU6egd8M"

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-ScreenrantHere at Screen Rant, there are few things we love more than hearing an awesome new fan theory. In the fantasy world of Game of Thrones it seemed like pretty much anything was possible. You can’t fly a dragon without encountering an ancient prophecy just vague enough to be promising. There are tons of great characters, interesting arcs, and tantalizing plot points. So it’s no wonder we had tons of great ideas about what would happen during season 8 of the show. Well. . .that was definitely something. No, we’re not going to complain about everything that wasn’t perfect but today we’re going to honor some of the best fan theories that would have been way more awesome than what actually went down in the show. We loved the idea of Jaime Lannister being Azor Ahai reborn but it seemed like the whole Lord of Light thing never really worked out. There were tons of theories about popular characters like Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow but the show featured no shortage of throwaway plot points and misdirection where they were concerned. We had also predicted everyone from Arya Stark to Varys would take down Cersei Lannister but no mere human had the honor when push came to shove.What was your favorite idea for the show that didn’t manage to make it into the official canon?

Subscribe to our channel for more awesome videos: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-ScreenrantWelcome back to ScreenRant! Did you just see John Wick 3? Do you still have the sound of bullets echoing in your ears? Well, you’re not alone! Bigger and better than the first two John Wick movies, Keanu Reeves returned to officially make this assassin’s story a trilogy and we couldn’t be happier! With so much high-octane action, there are plenty of details you can easily miss. But no worries or blood oath needed, we’ll recap it all here for you. So sit back and get ready to dive deep into some crazy details, including a potential storyline for John Wick 4!The doctor John Wick visits in the minutes leading up to his excommunicado status is actor Randall Duk Kim, who played The Keymaker in The Matrix Reloaded. During the library brawl that will give you a whole new way to look at your own book collection, Wick faces off against a giant man -- one who stands at seven feet high and three inches tall. If he looked familiar -- the last time you probably saw him was on an NBA court. This time around, we got the mysterious subtitle “Parabellum” and immediately went to Google to get more information. Would it be Halle Berry’s character name? Does the movie somehow connect more to The Matrix? Is that the name of a new dog Wick rescues from the pound? Watch to see all of these easter eggs, hidden moments, and great details from John Wick: Chapter 3. The film presented plenty of clues for the upcoming fourth movie as well!Our Social Media:https://twitter.com/screenranthttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRanthttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRantOur Websitehttp://screenrant.com/"

Subscribe to our channel for more awesome videos: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-ScreenrantThe internet is a flood with theories after the jam packed new trailer for Spider-Man: Far From Home. But while most are concerning the intentions of Mysterio and his intriguing allusion to a multiverse, a theory about a different villain is gaining traction online. We’re talking about the involvement of a classic Spider-Man villain in the Chameleon, a character with a highly specific power set we think he’ll be putting to use in Far From Home. Namely, his ability to shapeshift into other people, a characteristic that has us taking a second look at Far From Home’s use of Nick Fury. Chameleon is a man with many faces, and in the comics, he's been known to work with Mysterio to create elaborate illusions. The theory goes as follows: The Nick Fury we see in the Spider-Man: Far From Home trailer is not Nick Fury at all but actually the Chameleon in disguise.We’ve got comic book precedent, real-life movie news, and some good old fashion theorisin’ to back us up.

Subscribe to ScreenRant for more videos: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-ScreenrantThe fans have spoken. And if there’s one thing we know for sure, people have wildly different opinions about how well Game of Thrones ended. So - when the ash cleared, were you in love with the decisions made by our showrunners, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss? Do you believe they stayed true to George R. R. Martin’s initial vision or did they sully all the solid worldbuilding and gutsy storytelling that so defined Westeros throughout much of 8 year run? We here at ScreenRant are sifting through the online praise and vitriol. We’re listening to all the spiders online spreading both thoughtful criticism and loud dissent. And by the end of this video, we’ll come close to determining why, oh why so many fans felt the last six (or more) episodes fell flatter than the Red Keep at the end of “The Bells.” Apparently, even the GOT cast was taken by surprise. And although Daenerys has been teasing her relentless fury for years, most of us were surprised by the extent of her quest for vengeance. Sure, this is the same woman who said “I will take what is mine, with fire and blood I will take it.” But geez, did we think she’d go this far? Maybe we didn’t expect this because of poor writing? Or perhaps the same sloppy mistakes - that allowed coffee cups and water bottles to make it into the final cuts of episodes - were to blame? Whether you hated the rushed pacing or were thrown by the change in style, join us as we decide whether this series ultimately ends up among the ranks of the white book or should get booted out the moon door.Our Social Media:https://twitter.com/screenranthttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRanthttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRantOur Websitehttp://screenrant.com/"
