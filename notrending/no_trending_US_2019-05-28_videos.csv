As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content.

The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.Huge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!The balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.Special thanks to Patreon supporters:Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme and everyone who provided feedback on an early draft of this video.Thanks to:Las Virgenes Reservoir for footage of initial shade ball dumpEuro-Matic for bird into jet-engine footageResearched and Produced by Casey RentzAnimations by Maria RaykovaMusic from http://epidemicsound.com Colorful Animation 4 SeaweedAnd from Kevin MacLeod Marty Gots a PlanThis is an educational video about the science of water quality."

There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.Filming by Raquel Nuno"

Thankfully, using Wix, it's easy, accessible, and affordable too! Get your own URL, customize your layout, add key features like portfolios or shopping options (there are over 200 features to choose from!), and ‚Äî of course ‚Äî get creative! Follow the link to Wix at the top of the description to get started, or if you feel like you want some help, tweet me @mrkatedotcom your profile with the hashtag #CreativeWeirdoSpotlight and for the next Creative Weirdo Spotlight, we might be building your page!

Subscribe to our channel for more awesome videos: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-ScreenrantSpider-Man‚Äôs MCU contract is coming to an end. Originally, Sony gave Marvel the rights to have Spider-Man for five films. Spider-Man: Far From Home will be number five. Due to this, fans are talking about the possibility of Spider-Man departing the MCU and going back to Sony. Sony are creating their own version of the MCU, the Sony Marvel Universe with the film rights of Marvel characters they still have. However, if a new deal can be agreed, that won‚Äôt be the case. In fact, one of Sony‚Äôs newer, popular Spider-related characters could move into the MCU as well. That character being Venom. In the video today, we will be discussing a little history on the Disney and Sony deal on Spider-Man. Such as how it came about and what the deal exactly included. Then, we‚Äôll be looking at how Tom Hardy‚Äôs Venom may already exist within the MCU.  We also examine the possibility that Venom may be introduced properly in Far From Home. To top all of it off, we‚Äôll be discussing the circumstances of how the symbiote-hero could be brought in to make his MCU debut. From alternate dimensions, to time travel, and Marvel‚Äôs expanding cosmic lore, we take a look at a variety of possible avenues.

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-ScreenrantHere at Screen Rant, there are few things we love more than hearing an awesome new fan theory. In the fantasy world of Game of Thrones it seemed like pretty much anything was possible. You can‚Äôt fly a dragon without encountering an ancient prophecy just vague enough to be promising. There are tons of great characters, interesting arcs, and tantalizing plot points. So it‚Äôs no wonder we had tons of great ideas about what would happen during season 8 of the show. Well. . .that was definitely something. No, we‚Äôre not going to complain about everything that wasn‚Äôt perfect but today we‚Äôre going to honor some of the best fan theories that would have been way more awesome than what actually went down in the show. We loved the idea of Jaime Lannister being Azor Ahai reborn but it seemed like the whole Lord of Light thing never really worked out. There were tons of theories about popular characters like Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow but the show featured no shortage of throwaway plot points and misdirection where they were concerned. We had also predicted everyone from Arya Stark to Varys would take down Cersei Lannister but no mere human had the honor when push came to shove.What was your favorite idea for the show that didn‚Äôt manage to make it into the official canon?

Subscribe to our channel for more awesome videos: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-ScreenrantWelcome back to ScreenRant! Did you just see John Wick 3? Do you still have the sound of bullets echoing in your ears? Well, you‚Äôre not alone! Bigger and better than the first two John Wick movies, Keanu Reeves returned to officially make this assassin‚Äôs story a trilogy and we couldn‚Äôt be happier! With so much high-octane action, there are plenty of details you can easily miss. But no worries or blood oath needed, we‚Äôll recap it all here for you. So sit back and get ready to dive deep into some crazy details, including a potential storyline for John Wick 4!The doctor John Wick visits in the minutes leading up to his excommunicado status is actor Randall Duk Kim, who played The Keymaker in The Matrix Reloaded. During the library brawl that will give you a whole new way to look at your own book collection, Wick faces off against a giant man -- one who stands at seven feet high and three inches tall. If he looked familiar -- the last time you probably saw him was on an NBA court. This time around, we got the mysterious subtitle ‚ÄúParabellum‚Äù and immediately went to Google to get more information. Would it be Halle Berry‚Äôs character name? Does the movie somehow connect more to The Matrix? Is that the name of a new dog Wick rescues from the pound? Watch to see all of these easter eggs, hidden moments, and great details from John Wick: Chapter 3. The film presented plenty of clues for the upcoming fourth movie as well!Our Social Media:https://twitter.com/screenranthttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRanthttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRantOur Websitehttp://screenrant.com/"

It honestly feels like we just moved in at Baylor‚Ä¶ where do you think we will live when we go back???It felt like #moving out of our apartment took FOREVER‚Ä¶ with two of us, we just have SO MUCH stuff! A lot of the #Freshman kids that were moving out of their dorms had like, one bed and a few boxes of clothes and school supplies. Then there‚Äôs us... hauling out of our #dorm a family's worth of furniture and home decor! üòÇ Plus, we had stuff for 2 students, not just 1! We made so many awesome friends at Baylor, a few of which helped us load up our car, and haul it to a storage unit! Nothing makes you feel more like an adult than moving out WITHOUT your parents, and finding and renting your own storage unit! We‚Äôre doing some serious adulting, y‚Äôall! üôàTelling our friends goodbye for the summer was actually a lot harder than we anticipated. I know we‚Äôll see them again in 3 months, but it‚Äôs still difficult to say goodbye to our freshman year and the memories tied to it. It‚Äôs kind of like the end of an era, especially since when we go back we will be starting as college juniors in Baylor's business program! (We might not see as much of our Freshman friends as we did this year since we will be a year ahead.)As much as we're going to miss our friends over the summer, I will NOT be missing Business Calculus! We are SO excited to have a break from our tough 18-credit class schedule, and will be able to enjoy the summer with our family! (Paisley missed us, I am sure!)Also, a HUGE thank you to Jeffrey, Antoine, Anna, Brad, Sean, Tina, Cameron, Jensen, who helped us move out!! When do you finish school for the summer?

It seems that even from his earlier days there existed darkness within him, a darkness that only grew with time. I believe Euron is a psychopath. According to the dictionary, psychopathy is defined by impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, and egotistical traits. The word psychopath does not imply delusional thought or irrational action. Euron thinks extremely highly of himself and is incapable of empathizing with other people. And now he seeks final Ascension. The Horn, Victarion, and Holy Men all seem key to Euron‚Äôs Grand Plan.Thanks for watching!Cover Art by: Bella Bergolts: https://bergolts.artstation.com/projects/OV6dwPlease consider supporting this channel on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ideasoficeandfireThe Book I helped write: https://www.amazon.com/Thrones-Effect-HBOs-Conquered-Culture/dp/0998029947/ref=sr_1_1?crid=A2RMTG1N5WWR&keywords=the+thrones+effect&qid=1558142871&s=gateway&sprefix=thrones+eff%2Caps%2C139&sr=8-1Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRELike me on Facebook!: https://www.facebook.com/IOIAFFeel free to leave a comment like and subscribe!Thanks For Watching!"

Please see my comments below with regards to reports the video was partially faked.  Go to https://NordVPN.com/MarkRober and use code MARKROBER to get 75% off a 3 year plan and an extra month for free.My buddy Sean posted a video with more details of the build: https://youtu.be/IpMxOmUcfOINote about 2 missing the reactions in the video (I posted this on all my social channels immediately after it happened)- I was presented with information that caused me to doubt the veracity of 2 of the 5 reactions in the video.  These were reactions that were captured during a two week period while the device was at house 2 hours away from where I live.  I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help.  To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package.  It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the ‚Äúthieves were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.  From the footage I received from the phones which intentionally only record at specific times, this wasn‚Äôt clear to me. I have since removed those reactions from the original video (originally 6:26-7:59).  I‚Äôm really sorry about this.  Ultimately, I am responsible for the content that goes on my channel and I should have done more here.  I can vouch for that the reactions were genuine when the package was taken from my house.  Having said that, I know my credibility is damaged but I encourage you to look at the types of videos I‚Äôve been making for the past 7 years.  This is my first ever video with some kind of ‚Äúprank and like I mentioned in the video, it‚Äôs pretty removed from my comfort zone and I should have done more.  I‚Äôm especially gutted because so much thought, time, money and effort went into building the device and I hope this doesn‚Äôt just taint the entire effort as ‚Äúfake.  It genuinely works (like all the other things I‚Äôve built on my channel) and we‚Äôve made all the code and build info public.  Again, I‚Äôm sorry for putting something up on my channel that was misleading.  That is totally on me and I will take all necessary steps to make sure it won‚Äôt happen again.High Speed camera courtesy of https://www.aimed-research.com/.

They rent high speed cameras at killer prices.  Hit them up.ELI20 version:  I answered why you want a large outlet area but not necessarily why it curves like that.  Anytime you have a sudden change in cross-sectional area in the horn you will get waves reflecting back at the source.  You don't want that because that is wasted energy that could have moved forward.  Even if it goes from a small cross-section to a larger, if you do it suddenly you get those wasted waves.  So you want the horn to basically be asymptotic at the exit so you never have a jump in discontinuity when it exits to the wide open air.  So a directors cone isn't as good as the curved shapes I showed because it still has the sudden change when it dumps into the open air.MUSIC-0:10- Arrow- Andrew Applepie - http://andrewapplepie.com/1:08- Dance- Danijel Zambo- https://danijel-zambo.bandcamp.com/2:00- Kalimba Jam- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/3:00- New shoes- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/7:30- Ceral Killa- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/8:47- Q- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/9:46 Too Happy to be cool by Notebreak- https://soundcloud.com/notebreak/dubstep-too-happy-to-be-coolSummary:  I made a huge horn and broke glass with it and explored why horns are shaped the way they are.MERCH-They are soft- https://teespring.com/stores/markroberPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub****************************************¬≠I make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTubeFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTubeTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRoberINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/"

Today is another squishy makeover, obviously. I took on a couple really unique ones today. Actually kinda scary....and creepy. Plus one super basic one LOL. Which makeover do you like best?Also. The Koala issue that I mentioned about my LAST makeover video (this is serious). I really don't think that squishy was a koala. Koalas have rounded ears (the squishy had long floppy ears aka a BUNNY COSTUME) and vertical noses (that squishy had a very horizontal nose: BEAR). It also had a very pronounced rim around the face (You can see it in the version I showed today, since it's a COSTUME!) Anddd it was otherwise just plain so i have no idea why most people said it was a koala. But, LET THE DEBATE BEGIN! hahahahaWelcome to another episode of squishy makeovers, where I transform ugly, used, old, dirty, cheap or unwanted squishies (donated by my subscribers) into my own creations. I repair, paint and cut away for hours on end to complete these. Hopefully you like them. Get used to lots of rainbow and sprinkles, because I am addicted to both!I always try to give painting tips and advice, while trying to make i fun.WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...BAKING VIDEOS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQIQMIZWG-Y&list=PL807ptvhwHpciWBzyd5NsZcWMRbwBGSFbVIDEO FACTS:‚ÄìThe ballet video of me I showed was from 2012. I was in 11th grade. I love how they edited the recording to zoom out when I fell. Trying to take attention away from the fact I literally fell on my butt haha________ Materials List__________http://www.moriah.video/materials.html_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.6. CAN I USE ACRYLIC PAINT ON SQUISHIES?I would not recommend that. Acrylic paint will either make the squishy hard, or it will crack and flake off very easily. 8. CAN YOU DO MORE SQUISHIES IN EACH VIDEO OR DO MAKEOVER VIDEOS EVERY WEEK?I wish I could! But these videos take me about 30-50 hours to film and edit. I spend multiple weeks working on them (in combination with my other videos) so it‚Äôs not really possible to do these any more than I am already doing without lowering the quality. PLUS! I want to keep up with my art and craft videos as well ‚ò∫___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYsPURCHASE ME PRODUCTSCREATE THIS BOOK:https://amzn.to/2vUerfICREATE THIS BOOK 2:https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9fME MERCH:https://teespring.com/stores/moriah-elizabethGET TO KNOW MEBECOME A PATRON (GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE CONTENT):https://www.patreon.com/moriahelizabethVISIT ME WEBSITE:http://www.moriah.video/INSTAGRAM: instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficialCONTACT MEEMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART:Artwork@Moriah.videoFOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES ONLY:Business@Moriah.video_MAIL ME_For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address :)‚Ä¢FOR SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY PLEASE!

Today, I'm gonna bring you guys along with me to paint over my old, boring cloth organizers. They're pretty plain and white and since I'm going for a very colorful look in my new art room, I thought I could give them a little makeover.I'm in the process of decorating my whole art room, so if you like this video, I may do more like this.These are the typical Ikea cube shelves that everyone and their mother has. I felt like this was something good to share with everyone because I've never seen anyone else do this, and I think it is a pretty easy way to put a personal touch on a room.Obviously you wouldn't have to do this as obnoxiously as me lol. You could be more subdued and classy with it. Or use stencils and whatnot if you don't want to free-hand it.TIPS:Fabric paint works really great on these, but if you can‚Äôt find fabric paint, make sure you at least use a paint that is flexible so that it doesn‚Äôt crack when you're dragging these in and out of the shelves. Probably not best to use something like acrylic paint. Unless you combine it with a fabric medium.WHAT YOU NEED:1. Cube Shelf  (I‚Äôm using the Kallax Shelf from Ikea)2. Cloth box insert (or you can use wooden bins)3. Fabric Paint (switch with acrylic paint if using wooden bins)Im thinking about how to decorate the remaining 4. Not sure if I should do them in the same theme, a different theme or STORAGE BINS (affiliate link):https://amzn.to/2JfiPh4VIDEO FACTS:‚ÄìIf you notice on my very ‚ÄúMESSY‚Äù plan, I was going to do metallic accents‚Ä¶.obviously I changed my mind about that. I just decided I didn‚Äôt want that look‚Ä¶..‚ÄìI wanted them to each be unique in the own way, but unify them with color. they all have a light rainbow, a dark rainbow and white accents.‚ÄìI decided not to paint the sides, back or inside of the boxes (only the front) because1. Those areas aren‚Äôt visible unless the bin is open and 2.

It‚Äôs a pleasant city, and they known especially for meat. In this video we go on a Brazilian food tour of Curitiba, explore some of the iconic meat dishes of the city, and eat a 5 kilo family sandwich! #Brazil #BrazilianFood #hugefoodMercearia Fantinato - Carne de on√ßa (Jaguar meat), known as jaguar meat, yet of course not jaguar at all, this steak tartare (raw minced beef) got its name because of the raw meat breath you‚Äôll have after you eat it. It‚Äôs mixed table-side, and it‚Äôs delicious.Price - 53.99 BRL ($13.54)Costel√£o do Ga√∫cho - One of the things that Curitiba is known for, and all of southern Brazil, is meat - and especially the beef ribs are among the prized cut. Costel√£o do Ga√∫cho is an amazing restaurant that specializes in beef ribs. The owner is a master, treating each rack of ribs with respect and roasting and smoking them with precision. I loved his table saw method of cutting the ribs. The ribs were outstanding, as was the entire meal with all the side salads and dishes.4 Beans Coffee Co. - We stopped in for a quick coffee, but that turned into a coffee roasting session, which was fantastic.Lanchonete da Lombada - Here we go, the mega 5 kg. Lombada sandwich. Lombada means speedbump in Portuguese, because it was formerly a street food stall right in front of the speedbump. It was just insane, huge bun, layers of meat, hot dogs, massive quantities of squeeze cheese. It‚Äôs not a food challenge, but a very popular local family meal in Curitiba, Brazil. Total price - 50 BRL ($12.45)Tio Dog (Uncle Dog) - Probably one of the most iconic of all the Brazilian fast food in Curitiba is TIo Dog, specialising in a number of different sandwiches and hot dogs. We got The Philadelphia, a bun filled with hot dogs, a variety of unknown sauces, and little crunchy chip fries. It‚Äôs one of those late night impulse foods - not something I‚Äôd eat on a daily basis.Curitiba was fun, and it was a Brazilian food tour of meat!Thanks to Guilherme and Rafa from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

Today we went on a short hike to the famous Telegraph rock, and then ate an incredible Brazilian seafood meal. #Brazil #RiodeJaneiro #foodOysters - It was about an hour drive from the center of Rio, and we arrived to the oyster man - a little stall where a man has been selling oysters since Guilherme was a child. His oysters were small, but they were flavorful, with just a squeeze of lime. Perfect way to begin this Brazilian food day. Price - 12 for 10 BRL ($2.50)Pedra Do Tel√©grafo - We then drove to a small beach town and climbed up the hill to a point known as Pedra Do Tel√©grafo, or Telegraph rock. It‚Äôs most famou now because of social media, and people take a photo in a way that it looks like they are dangling from a rock cliff. The views are spectacular and well worth climbing when you‚Äôre in Rio.Gugut Restaurante - Located in Vargem Grande neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, we met up with Marcelo to eat a massive Brazilian seafood meal, especially dishes from the Espirito Santo state of Brazil.Moqueca - There are two versions of this amazing dish, a fish stew, one from Espirito Santo and the other from Bahia (stay tuned for Bahia coming soon). He added in tomatoes, onions, and cilantro, followed by fish. It was simple but delicious, relying on the fresh fish to really made it special. Gugut Restaurant is not cheap, but they serve top notch seafood, great quality, and very fresh. All the food was delicious. Total price - 400 BRL ($100.32)And that completes this Brazilian seafood and hike in Rio de Janeiro, another wonderful day in Brazil.Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

But to be honest I had never been to any outside of Brazil - and there was no better place to have my first Brazilian meat churrascaria experience than in Brazil.Churrascaria Palace (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/xtKKEisbcvWv9P8m6) - We chose to go to Churrascaria Palace, a meat restaurant located in Copacabana Beach, Rio de Janeiro. As soon as I stepped into the restaurant, I could smell the aroma of the roasting meats, and it was a great upscale, yet laid back atmosphere, with live music.Chef Silva took care of us from the moment we stepped in and first showed us the kitchen where the meats were being roasted. It‚Äôs very interesting to learn about the different cuts of meat that they use in Brazil, which are unique to Brazil. One of the unique and beloved types of meat is cupim, which comes from the beef hump from Zebu cattle.Once Chef Silva started bringing us meats, he did not joke around - the Brazilian steakhouse bbq meats started flowing non stop. A Brazilian steakhouse bbq is typically served Rod√≠zio, meaning it‚Äôs all you can eat, but the meat is not served buffet style, but rather it‚Äôs served to you at your plate. They slice it in front of you, and then you use your tongs to grab the meat as its sliced in front of you.Chef Silva served us 14 types of meat, including some Amazon river fish. He told us he only served us the premium cuts, and there were many other less premium cuts that we were too full to even try.Brazilian food is often heavy on the meat, and there‚Äôs no better way to experience Brazilian meat than with a churrascaria!Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

There are estimates of as many as 1,000 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many of the favelas in Rio de Janeiro are full cities within themselves, where nearly everything is available.It‚Äôs without a doubt that a lot of crime and organized underground criminal activity happens and is controlled in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. However, favelas across Brazil are home to some of the most hard working, friendly, happy, and creative people in Brazil as well. So in this video my goal was to meet and to highlight some of the amazing people that call favelas home. Rocinha - The first favela we visited was Rocinha, the biggest favela in Rio, one of the biggest in Brazil. We met up with Guilherme who took us on a walking tour to some viewpoints and to some Brazilian food places.Sabor da Ro√ßa - The most well known little snack shop on this street in Rocinha, we stopped for a coxinha, one of the top Brazilian food snacks. It was packed with chicken and with some hot sauce it was amazing. Price -  2.5 BRL ($0.63)For lunch we stopped at an alleyway restaurant in Rocinha, where he cooked up a lunch set included beef ribs, cassava, pasta, rice, and beans. It was simple, but delicious and hearty.Price - 10 BRL ($2.52)Morro da Provid√™ncia - Favela number two is one of the first favelas of Rio and located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, near the port and up on a hill on the side of the cliff. We met up with Jura, who is an absolute Brazilian food cooking legend and an amazing person.One of Jura‚Äôs most famous dishes is nhoque de camar√£o, an Italian but Brazilian potato noodles in Jura‚Äôs own creation sauce of shrimp and coconut milk. It was simply outstanding, all made from scratch.But the dish I was most interested in eating and which Jura expertly cooked, again from scratch was her feijoada - often considered the national dish of Brazil, and one of my personal favorite foods of Brazil as well - there are few dishes of the world more comforting than beans and pig parts with rice. When you‚Äôre in Brazil, you can eat feijoada at many restaurants, but home-cooked is by far the best.Thank you Jura and Elena!!This was one of the best days I had in Brazil in terms of learning, meeting people, and food, and it‚Äôs an experience and memories I‚Äôll never forget. You hear a lot of the negative that comes out of favelas in Brazil, and it is true. However, the positive side and the amazing people, are not often recognized, and it was truly memorable to see and learn about this side of hope in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

Finally, the time has come. In this Brazilian street food tour in Rio de Janeiro, we‚Äôll go to eat some of the best street food snacks and dishes, some hole in the wall style Brazilian food restaurants, and also visit some of the most unbelievable and gorgeous sights and attractions in Rio de Janeiro. It‚Äôs one of the most beautiful cities I‚Äôve ever visited.Here‚Äôs the Brazilian food and things we did:Mineiro, Sausage Sandwich - 5 BRL ($1.26) - For Brazilian breakfast we headed to Mineiro for his neighborhood grilled sausage sandwich, topped with his house made aioli dressing, cheese, and lettuce, and his own home-made chili sauce. He‚Äôs not only an amazing guy, but his sausage sandwich is outstanding. When you‚Äôre in Rio de Janeiro, you don‚Äôt want to miss it. Located just outside Siqueira Campos MRT Metro station (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA), sets up in the morning about 7 am.Trem do Corcovado - 65 BRL ($16.44) - Christ the Redeemer - I pre-bought tickets online for the tram, so when we arrived we just picked up and printed the tickets. The tram took about 20 minutes and Christ The Redeemer at the top was breathtaking.Selaron Steps - Another attraction in Rio de Janeiro that I wasn‚Äôt going to miss was the Selaron Steps, created by Chilean artist Selaron. They are so cool and so iconic.Lunch at Bar Rex - For some seriously meaty Brazilian food, Bar Rex is the spot. They serve an major selection of drinks, but they also specialize in food like roasted chicken, sausages, and the oxtail. The food was outstanding, and the owners are just so cool. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/ZeshTp5D3ggLoGx87Ipanema Beach - World famous, one of the most well known beaches in the world, and for a good reason - the scenery is spectacular. We had a tea with Marcelo (5 BRL ($1.26) and then tried some of the Brazilian local favorite comfort Biscoito Globo cassava snacks. Finally, another iconic Brazilian drink is the caipirinha (15 BRL ($3.79) made on the beach.Copacabana Beach - Next up on this Brazilian street food and attractions tour we stopped at the famous Copacabana Beach and had a coconut (6.50 BRL ($1.64) and continued on the Red Beach in Urca to get a good view of Sugarloaf Mountain (P√£o de A√ß√∫car).Bar Urca - Also in Urca, you‚Äôll find Bar Urca, an old food and bar establishment that‚Äôs famous for serving empada de camar√£o (6.50 BRL ($1.64), shrimp filled pastries. Many people order and then sit on the edge of the water in the evening. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/RZAmnMsKWMtvuebFABar Gato de Botas - A Brazilian boteco is a bar and restaurant that serves small plates of food similar to tapas. The owner of Bar Gato de Botas is a legend and his plates of Brazilian food are delicious. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/efeUxoamaHa77vNR6Brazilian meat kebabs - Finally to end this incredible street food tour of Rio de Janeiro, we returned back to the same spot where we had breakfast, but in the evening, a different yet equally friendly man sets up selling Brazilian meat kebas and home cooked Brazilian food. When you order a kebab, you can get it stopped with cassava powder and drenched in hot sauce - it was so good. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA Sets up in the evening about 6 pm.Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful city and this Brazilian street food tour and attraction in Rio was amazing - the food, the people, the scenery.Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.
