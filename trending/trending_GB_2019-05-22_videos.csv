As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.Flipchart artwork by Maria RaykovaFilmed by Raquel NunoThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci"

I am not the best at baking, but I try and have fun. Try not to get triggered.This time I made (not sure if it's baking if you don' use an oven lol) my dessert taco squishy.

Despite this terminal diagnosis he's still fighting to stay alive.Harry’s parents, Charlotte and James, set up Harry’s Giant Pledge working with giantpledge.com and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. Their aim is to raise money for research into Ewing’s Sarcoma and other childhood cancers to ensure children like Harry have a better chance of surviving. Harry was diagnosed with cancer on 2 August 2018 when a routine scan on a small lump showed a tumour the size of a large baked potato inside Harry’s right chest. Harry was 4.In the space of a few minutes on that hot sunny afternoon the Shaw Family's life was changed forever.Follow us on Instagramhttps://www.instagram.com/jonathanjolyhttps://www.instagram.com/annasaccone1 YEAR AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yefx1obrZIw2 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wdqjxQi7TA&t=31s3 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_BAXcwVDOw4 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_xMOBUHOoU5 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFBhH3d806c6 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C2K_2EwmgM7 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BACglxXJ9Jc8 YEARS AGO https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgouzA5GUSUBelow are a couple affiliate links for products that we’re always using and asked about…Chicco NEXT2ME Crib - https://amzn.to/2uj1HOjHandbag Organiser - https://amzn.to/2lJDJrDGH5 Camera - https://amzn.to/2kdUyKBG7X Camera - https://amzn.to/2kbvHXGAnker PowerWave Wireless Charger - https://amzn.to/2HXU1pzCoffee Machine - https://amzn.to/2kaRvTdStokke Tripp High Chair - https://amzn.to/2kbYqeRStair Gate - https://amzn.to/2s1yFSbAlessia's Baby Walker - https://amzn.to/2GBZQZ4Car Seats - https://amzn.to/2katN9AThe Great Cat Nap - https://amzn.to/2rYI3WLHydrateM8 Water Bottle - https://amzn.to/2GE8qqlNume Curling Wand - https://amzn.to/2s0vtGuAnna's Mac Lipstick (Honey Love) - https://amzn.to/2rVIJvUWatch our Proposal videohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxQ4Vu02HEsWatch our wedding videohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UYOQg-aJZwWatch the birth of our baby girl (Emilia)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrNulUx7xcWatch the birth of our baby boy (Eduardo)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqU3wGXnV3EWatch the birth of our baby girl (Alessia)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVoGKXUE-8k&tWatch the birth of our baby boy (Andrea)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE6pLbIXHoAWatch the birth of our Maltese Puppieshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ex4S4uJMvgEverything you wanted to know about me before the videoshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnKVnFlRkAkFriendliest Friends Channel http://www.youtube.com/friendliestfriendsJonathan's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/jonathanjolyAnna's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/thestylediet- Add Jonathan on Snapchat: sacconejolys- Add Anna on Snapchat: asacconejoly- Follow Jonathan on Instagram: http://instagram.com/jonathanjoly- Follow Anna on Instagram: http://instagram.com/annasacconeFollow us on TWITTERhttp://www.twitter.com/jonathanjolyhttp://www.twitter.com/annasacconeJoin us on FACEBOOKhttps://www.facebook.com/JonathanPatrickJolyCheck out our INSTAGRAM pictureshttp://instagram.com/jonathanjolyhttp://instagram.com/annasaccone*******************************Short History of SACCONEJOLYsIn 2008 Anna was uploading beauty videos to youtube on her own channel and Jonathan was helping her behind the scenes.In late 2009 Jonathan set up this channel because he wanted to do his own youtube videos. What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYSthis channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYsWhen Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.They choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.Jonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have four children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly, Alessia Saccone Joly and Andrea Saccone Joly they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.They moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.Using an Affiliate link means that we receive a percentage of the revenue made from purchasing products through this link.

Our first look of Got S8 E6 and the series finale. Please Subscribe now! - http://bit.ly/PetePeppersHBO released the Game of Thrones Season 8 Episode 6 preview as a promo trailer. This video breaks it down scene by scene and discusses what we might expect to see in the next episode of Game of Thrones’ final season. Episode 6 is the final episode in the series, and we expect a big finale for the show.We see Daenerys looking over her troops after the battle for King’s Landing. We see Jon Snow and Davos, Tyrion Lannister, and Arya Stark walking through the destruction that is left behind. The teaser doesn’t show us much more about episode 6, but we can speculate about what might happen in the finale.Game of Thrones s8 episode 6 will be one of the most anticipated 80 minutes of television in this era. Now that Daenerys has defeated Cersei what will she do in King’s Landing? We expect that Tyrion will be in a tough situation with the Queen, but how will Jon Snow deal with what he’s witnessed? Arya’s future is also interesting since she has witnessed the suffering first hand. We saw her take a turn in episode 5, but will she turn back and seek vengeance? Will Daenerys turn things around or has she become the Mad Queen who has to be stopped?What did you think will happen in Game of Thrones season 8 episode 6, and how do think Jon and Arya will react to what happened in episode 5?  Do you fear that Daenerys going mad is the end of her story?  Let us know in the comments what you think will happen in the rest of the final season of Game of Thrones on HBO, and in this series finale.Game of Thrones Stuff:Game of Thrones Seasons 1-7: https://amzn.to/2VWCoxtFire and Blood: https://amzn.to/2TF3c9aA Song of Ice and Fire book series: https://amzn.to/2u2ffOmGoT Season 7: https://amzn.to/2Hwwv6b****New books for season 8 pre-orders:The Storyboards https://amzn.to/2UuRVEpThe Art of Game of Thrones https://amzn.to/2TwTNjCThe Photography of Game of Thrones https://amzn.to/2Txz8w4The Costumes of Game of Thrones https://amzn.to/2Uy8WOlGame of Thrones Theory Videos:Are the gods real - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM6lBzRQpdEGods part 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMSTgqOYjWoArthur Dayne - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDpmkdeH8toThe Isle of Faces - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfiwB5XmslAHowland Reed - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5P224p8zCgBran's Purpose - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y22-h3LdGKATourney History & Lore - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lke9hsjFrzYBran & Three Eyed Raven - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBqKCdVVuygWestworld Playlist - http://bit.ly/WestwoldS01Twin Peaks Season 3 Playlist - http://bit.ly/TwinPeaksS3Follow me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/PetePeppersJoin me on Patreon! - https://www.patreon.com/PetePeppersLike my Facebook Page - https://www.facebook.com/FleaBottomPete/Follow me on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/fleabottom_peteAsk me questions on Quora - https://www.quora.com/profile/Pete-Peppers#GameofThrones #GameofThronesSeason8 #GoTS8 #ForTheThrone"

Finally, the time has come. In this Brazilian street food tour in Rio de Janeiro, we’ll go to eat some of the best street food snacks and dishes, some hole in the wall style Brazilian food restaurants, and also visit some of the most unbelievable and gorgeous sights and attractions in Rio de Janeiro. It’s one of the most beautiful cities I’ve ever visited.Here’s the Brazilian food and things we did:Mineiro, Sausage Sandwich - 5 BRL ($1.26) - For Brazilian breakfast we headed to Mineiro for his neighborhood grilled sausage sandwich, topped with his house made aioli dressing, cheese, and lettuce, and his own home-made chili sauce. He’s not only an amazing guy, but his sausage sandwich is outstanding. When you’re in Rio de Janeiro, you don’t want to miss it. Located just outside Siqueira Campos MRT Metro station (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA), sets up in the morning about 7 am.Trem do Corcovado - 65 BRL ($16.44) - Christ the Redeemer - I pre-bought tickets online for the tram, so when we arrived we just picked up and printed the tickets. The tram took about 20 minutes and Christ The Redeemer at the top was breathtaking.Selaron Steps - Another attraction in Rio de Janeiro that I wasn’t going to miss was the Selaron Steps, created by Chilean artist Selaron. They are so cool and so iconic.Lunch at Bar Rex - For some seriously meaty Brazilian food, Bar Rex is the spot. They serve an major selection of drinks, but they also specialize in food like roasted chicken, sausages, and the oxtail. The food was outstanding, and the owners are just so cool. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/ZeshTp5D3ggLoGx87Ipanema Beach - World famous, one of the most well known beaches in the world, and for a good reason - the scenery is spectacular. We had a tea with Marcelo (5 BRL ($1.26) and then tried some of the Brazilian local favorite comfort Biscoito Globo cassava snacks. Finally, another iconic Brazilian drink is the caipirinha (15 BRL ($3.79) made on the beach.Copacabana Beach - Next up on this Brazilian street food and attractions tour we stopped at the famous Copacabana Beach and had a coconut (6.50 BRL ($1.64) and continued on the Red Beach in Urca to get a good view of Sugarloaf Mountain (Pão de Açúcar).Bar Urca - Also in Urca, you’ll find Bar Urca, an old food and bar establishment that’s famous for serving empada de camarão (6.50 BRL ($1.64), shrimp filled pastries. Many people order and then sit on the edge of the water in the evening. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/RZAmnMsKWMtvuebFABar Gato de Botas - A Brazilian boteco is a bar and restaurant that serves small plates of food similar to tapas. The owner of Bar Gato de Botas is a legend and his plates of Brazilian food are delicious. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/efeUxoamaHa77vNR6Brazilian meat kebabs - Finally to end this incredible street food tour of Rio de Janeiro, we returned back to the same spot where we had breakfast, but in the evening, a different yet equally friendly man sets up selling Brazilian meat kebas and home cooked Brazilian food. When you order a kebab, you can get it stopped with cassava powder and drenched in hot sauce - it was so good. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA Sets up in the evening about 6 pm.Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful city and this Brazilian street food tour and attraction in Rio was amazing - the food, the people, the scenery.Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food.

Both redefining and transcending the genre, “IT” became part of the cultural zeitgeist as well as the highest-grossing horror film of all time.Because every 27 years evil revisits the town of Derry, Maine, “It Chapter Two” brings the characters—who’ve long since gone their separate ways—back together as adults, nearly three decades after the events of the first film.  Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (“Zero Dark Thirty,” “Mama”) stars as Beverly, James McAvoy (“Split,” upcoming “Glass”) as Bill, Bill Hader (HBO’s “Barry,” “The Skeleton Twins”) as Richie, Isaiah Mustafa (TV’s “Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments”) as Mike, Jay Ryan (TV’s “Mary Kills People”) as Ben, James Ransone (HBO’s “The Wire”) as Eddie, and Andy Bean (“Allegiant,” Starz’ “Power”) as Stanley.  Reprising their roles as the original members of the Losers Club are Jaeden Martell as Bill, Wyatt Oleff as Stanley, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie, Finn Wolfhard as Richie, Sophia Lillis as Beverly, Chosen Jacobs as Mike, and Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben.  Bill Skarsgård returns in the seminal role of Pennywise.  Muschietti directed the film from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman (“IT,” “Annabelle: Creation”) based on the novel IT by Stephen King.  Barbara Muschietti, Dan Lin and Roy Lee produced the film, with Marty Ewing, Seth Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg serving as the executive producers.The behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Checco Varese (“The 33”), Oscar-winning production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (“The Shape of Water”), editor Jason Ballantine (“IT,” “Mad Max: Fury Road”), and Oscar-nominated costume designer Luis Sequeira (“The Shape of Water,” “Mama”).  The music is by Benjamin Wallfisch (“Shazam!,” “Blade Runner 2049,” “IT”). New Line Cinema presents, a Vertigo Entertainment/Rideback Production, an Andy Muschietti film, “It Chapter Two.”  The film is slated for release in theaters and IMAX on September 6, 2019 and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

Put your skills to test against your toughest enemy yet - your own brothers-in-arms. Play Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint when it launches on PS4, Xbox One, and PC on October 4, 2019. Pre-order now for guaranteed access to the beta.#GhostRecon #BreakpointPlease SUBSCRIBE:http://bit.ly/UbisoftYouTubeChannel Visit our official channels for exclusive intel on Ghost Recon Wildlands:http://www.ghostrecon.comhttp://www.facebook.com/ghostrecon.usahttps://instagram.com/ghostrecon_us/http://www.twitter.com/ghostreconhttp://www.youtube.com/UbisoftnaTom Clancy’s Ghost® Recon Breakpoint is a military shooter set in a diverse, hostile, and mysterious open world that you can play entirely solo or in four-player co-op. Injured, without support, and hunted down by ex-Ghosts, you must fight to survive while lost in Auroa. Choose the right alliances and decide how to take down your toughest enemy.KEY FEATURESDISCOVER A MYSTERIOUS AND DIVERSE ARCHIPELAGOExplore Auroa, home of the Silicon Valley giant Skell Technology, both on- and off-road, in the air, on land, and at sea. Immerse yourself in a mysterious place where the most architecturally advanced buildings meet the wildest and most untamed nature. From the highest fjords and snowy peaks to the deepest swamps, meet different factions – from Skellers to Homesteaders to Outcasts – that will impact your mission. What happened to Jace Skell? Who is pulling the strings? Find the truth and clear the plot!TAKE DOWN YOUR EX-BROTHER-IN-ARMSFace your toughest enemies, the Wolves, a lethal ex–US military unit gone rogue, ready to use the most effective killing machines to take you down. The Wolves used to be you. They have the same training and experience as you have. They have seized the archipelago of Auroa, taking control of the most important resources of the island: the drones. And they are led by your ex-brother-in-arms, Colonel Cole D. Walker, so you will have no choice but to confront your former teammate. LIVE THE LIFE OF A TRUE GHOST STRANDED BEHIND ENEMY LINESTest your survival skills and adapt to the varied terrains of Auroa. Steep slopes, accumulating injuries, and fatigue are the new challenges for you to tackle. Set up a camp with your teammates, manage your equipment, class, and weapons in your bivouac, and fine-tune your strategies. If you’re wounded in battle, you’ll have to crawl to the safety of cover to heal yourself, or if a teammate goes down, you’ll need to pick them up and carry them to a safe place before treating their injuries. Use new tools, like the mini drone, that will allow you to sync shot several targets, even in solo.CUSTOMIZE YOUR GHOST AND EXPERIENCE FULL FREEDOM OF APPROACHCreate your character and choose among thousands of customization combinations to create your perfect Ghost. Loot materials from the world, craft and upgrade your weapons with multiple attachment possibilities, and customize your gear in order to adapt your Ghost to any situation and to fit your playstyle. Experiment with a brand new class system to give you more chances to defeat your enemies. Do you want to play assault? You can go berserk. Do you want to play sniper? You can get special ammunition that gives you more range and accuracy. You can also play stealthy with the Panther class, and use a smoke bomb to get away from your enemies. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint is all about your choice, your way to have fun.ENJOY A TRUE SOCIAL EXPERIENCE WITH NEW SHARED PROGRESSION AND BEST-IN-CLASS ENDGAME CONTENTHowever you decide to play, in Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint, you will always keep the same character: the same customization, the same skills, and the same weapons. You keep and improve your progression across both our PvE and PvP experiences. Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint is also a truly social experience. Find your friends in the new Social HUB, play the campaign together, or enter a PvP arena to take on an intense 4v4 match. The adventure does not stop there! The game will be regularly updated and supported years after launch. New story arcs will keep expanding the story, new features will be continuously added, and new classes and gameplay possibilities will available to players, as well as events and a brand-new type of endgame content: Raids.
