As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.Flipchart artwork by Maria RaykovaFilmed by Raquel NunoThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci"

At the risk of getting burned, Taji went to get a spray tan from one of Yelp‚Äôs worst-rated tanning salons to see if the reviews are accurate, or if they could redeem themselves.Watch more episodes of One Star Reviews with Taji: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqZBC60vuhM&list=PLDbSvEZka6GHgTPhrChu9GGP21k802Y7h&index=2&t=0sClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICEAbout VICE:The Definitive Guide To Enlightening Information.

His natural gravitation towards music lead to him to hip-hop; he began recording his fledgling verses on his cell phone. He quickly gained traction online, racking up millions of views on YouTube.Fittingly, he titled his 2018 mixtape 'Life B4 Fame' with the hopes that things would change for the better once his career really took off. He was right‚Äîwithin two days, his mixtape had amassed more than one million streams on MyMixtapez. Things will only go up from there, and if the snippets from his forthcoming Rich Homie Quando project are any sign, he‚Äôs only only getting better with time."

Both redefining and transcending the genre, ‚ÄúIT‚Äù became part of the cultural zeitgeist as well as the highest-grossing horror film of all time.Because every 27 years evil revisits the town of Derry, Maine, ‚ÄúIt Chapter Two‚Äù brings the characters‚Äîwho‚Äôve long since gone their separate ways‚Äîback together as adults, nearly three decades after the events of the first film.  Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain (‚ÄúZero Dark Thirty,‚Äù ‚ÄúMama‚Äù) stars as Beverly, James McAvoy (‚ÄúSplit,‚Äù upcoming ‚ÄúGlass‚Äù) as Bill, Bill Hader (HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúBarry,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Skeleton Twins‚Äù) as Richie, Isaiah Mustafa (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúShadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments‚Äù) as Mike, Jay Ryan (TV‚Äôs ‚ÄúMary Kills People‚Äù) as Ben, James Ransone (HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Wire‚Äù) as Eddie, and Andy Bean (‚ÄúAllegiant,‚Äù Starz‚Äô ‚ÄúPower‚Äù) as Stanley.  Reprising their roles as the original members of the Losers Club are Jaeden Martell as Bill, Wyatt Oleff as Stanley, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie, Finn Wolfhard as Richie, Sophia Lillis as Beverly, Chosen Jacobs as Mike, and Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben.  Bill Skarsg√•rd returns in the seminal role of Pennywise.  Muschietti directed the film from a screenplay by Gary Dauberman (‚ÄúIT,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnnabelle: Creation‚Äù) based on the novel IT by Stephen King.  Barbara Muschietti, Dan Lin and Roy Lee produced the film, with Marty Ewing, Seth Grahame-Smith and David Katzenberg serving as the executive producers.The behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Checco Varese (‚ÄúThe 33‚Äù), Oscar-winning production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (‚ÄúThe Shape of Water‚Äù), editor Jason Ballantine (‚ÄúIT,‚Äù ‚ÄúMad Max: Fury Road‚Äù), and Oscar-nominated costume designer Luis Sequeira (‚ÄúThe Shape of Water,‚Äù ‚ÄúMama‚Äù).  The music is by Benjamin Wallfisch (‚ÄúShazam!,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlade Runner 2049,‚Äù ‚ÄúIT‚Äù).

People have been bickering back and forth over whether the god of thunder gaining a noticeable amount of weight, letting his hair grow long and his beard get scraggly, and settling into a routine of beer, chips, and video games was a cheap attempt at laughs or an accurate depiction of the effects trauma and grief can have on a person. Amongst all this chatter, one person who has remained pretty quiet about fat Thor in Endgame is Thor himself, famously fit actor Chris Hemsworth. Thanks to Endgame directors Joe and Anthony Russo, we know how Hemsworth reacted to the news that his hammer-swinging hero character would sport a different physique in the film. Speaking in a recent interview with Sirius XM, the Russos shared that Hemsworth was totally on board for chubby Thor and was ready to take the character in a new direction. As Joe Russo put it, Hemsworth is up for anything. He likes to take risks. That's a nice way of putting it.Anthony chimed in from there, explaining that he and Joe gave Hemsworth a call to discuss where Thor's personal journey would go in Endgame and how his character arc would wrap up. The initial conversation took place quite a while before Endgame and its predecessor Infinity War, which were shot back-to-back, began filming, meaning the Russos and Hemsworth knew well in advance what Thor would look, feel, and act like in the epic ensemble movie. Anthony Russo said,Before the script was ready, when we called him to pitch the character arc, he was either still finishing or had just finished Ragnarok. But he was so energized by the work he had done with Taika [Waititi] in that movie in terms of coming up with a comedic and irreverent Thor.Anthony's brother Joe finished the thought, saying,And we were like, 'Wait until you hear what we've got for you.'Hemsworth couldn't open up much about what happened with Thor in Endgame or offer explicit details about the hero's transformation until the movie premiered in theaters in late April, but he did offer a tiny tease to USA Today ahead of the pic's debut. The Aussie actor told the outlet that he and the Russos had multiple, in-depth talks regarding Thor's change from the god of thunder with lightning coursing through his veins to a self-conscious guy that his fellow Avengers tease has Cheez Whiz flowing through him instead. Of course, Hemsworth had to keep mum about the specifics at that time, though he did explain that he, quote, wanted to do something different and push Thor to his limits in Endgame. He told USA Today,[The Russos] were on board and we sat for many hours and days and discussed kind of how far we could push it and what we could do different.Fat Thor certainly is different to any other iteration of the hero fans have seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe before. It was a bold move on the part of Hemsworth and the Russo brothers, and definitely caused a rift in the Marvel fandom, but it's evident that there was no ill intent behind the decision. Rather, it sounds like the Endgame team wanted to depict Thor in a brand-new light while making a point about how everyone handles feelings of grief and guilt in their own ways and how there isn't just one right way to be a hero. One of the most prominent takeaways from fat Thor in the film is that he never underwent a fat-to-fit transformation in order to boost his confidence or to prove to himself and others that he is worthy of being a superhero. Instead, Thor was able to summon his hammer Mjolnir and fight the brutal battle against Thanos at the end of Endgame, while keeping on the extra pounds he gained over the five years post-Snap. He may not look the way he used to, but he's just as powerful, and that's an important message to send to audiences. Like Avengers: Endgame screenwriter Christopher Markus once explained, We leave him in that state at the end of the movie. Even though he's emotionally resolved. We fix his problem, and it's not his weight‚Ä¶ And I think he is the ideal Thor at the end of the movie, and he's carrying some weight. And as Anthony Russo stated in a recent interview, We find 'fat Thor' as inspiring as any version of Thor because he's so relatable. It's a very human version of the character.Thor appears positioned to make a return in the MCU with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, given where he wound up at the end of Endgame. The Russos did note in their Sirius XM interview that it's ultimately up to director James Gunn whether Thor plays a part in the upcoming film, but if he does, it seems his big belly and bushy beard might be coming back, too.Watch the video to see the Endgame directors reveal how Chris Hemsworth reacted to Fat Thor!#FatThor #Thor #AvengersEndgame"
